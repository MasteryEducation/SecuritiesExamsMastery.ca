## 8.6 Understanding a Client’s Life Insurance Needs

It’s amazing how something as abstract as “future security” can feel so concrete when we start talking about life insurance—especially when you’ve got, say, a mortgage or a young family that relies on your income. I remember chatting with a friend, and she said, “I just never thought I needed it…until I realized what would happen to my kids if I wasn’t around.” That’s the heart of life insurance: It’s a financial safety net for those you care about, and it can be tied to mortgages, education funds, final expenses, business agreements—the list goes on.

Below, we’ll walk through what it means to truly understand a client’s life insurance needs, from that first “fact-find” conversation right down to the ongoing reviews that ensure coverage remains aligned with real-life changes.

### Gathering Client Information: The Fact-Find

Building the best financial plan starts with listening, asking questions, and collecting detailed information about your client’s financial and personal situation. In Canadian finance circles, this is commonly referred to as the “fact-find.”

• Purpose: The fact-find helps you build a comprehensive snapshot of a client’s situation:  
  – Dependants (e.g., spouse, children, parents)  
  – Income sources and stability  
  – Liabilities (e.g., mortgage, personal loans, business debts)  
  – Lifestyle goals (e.g., maintaining a certain standard of living)  
  – Estate objectives (e.g., leaving a legacy or covering final taxes)  

• Importance of Accuracy: If your client overlooks any debts, obligations, or specific financial goals, the entire insurance calculation or recommendation might be off. Honestly, it’s easy for people to forget certain details (like a small line of credit they took out for a renovation)—so use a thorough, structured questionnaire to gather all relevant info.

• Regulatory Context: In Canada, the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) requires firms and advisors to perform a Know Your Client (KYC) process, ensuring that any recommendations are suitable based on the client’s personal and financial circumstances. If you’re curious about official guidelines, CIRO (the national self-regulatory body that replaced IIROC and MFDA) has the latest resources at https://www.ciro.ca.

### Determining the Right Amount of Coverage

Once all the data is in, you can begin determining how much coverage the client really needs. A balanced approach is critical. Under-insuring can leave a family or business vulnerable; over-insuring might saddle the client with unnecessarily high premiums.

#### Core Factors to Consider

• Income Replacement: How much income would need to be replaced if the client passes away?  
• Debt Obligations: Mortgage, car loans, and any other outstanding liabilities that should be cleared to lighten the family’s financial load.  
• Future Expenses: Think children’s education, final medical bills, funeral costs, or even estate taxes (though Canada doesn’t apply a direct estate tax, the deemed disposition rules can create tax liabilities at death).  
• Existing Policies: Does the client already have some coverage through an employer (group coverage) or other personal policies?

### Approaches to Calculating Insurance Needs

Three popular methods—capital needs analysis, human life value approach, and layered strategies—help advisors arrive at a dollar amount that addresses the client’s unique circumstances. Sometimes you might blend different techniques or run each method separately and compare results.

#### Capital Needs Analysis

The capital needs analysis adds up all the projected costs and lumps them into a single figure. Examples of costs include funeral expenses, outstanding debts, future education expenses, and ongoing living costs for surviving dependants. Then, you subtract existing investments or insurance coverage to find the net shortfall.

A simplified equation might look like:

$$
\text{Insurance Coverage Needed} 
= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\bigl(\text{Annual Expense}_i \times \text{Prob. of Occurrence}\bigr) 
\;+\; \text{Outstanding Liabilities} 
\;-\; \text{Liquid Assets}
$$

This is a broad stroke, but it offers a systematic way to ensure all anticipated expenses (and some contingencies) are covered.

#### Human Life Value Approach

The human life value approach focuses on the client’s income-generating potential:

1. Estimate the client’s annual income.  
2. Account for personal consumption (the portion of income the insured person uses for themselves).  
3. Estimate the number of working years left.  
4. Factor in an appropriate discount rate (reflecting inflation and real-return rates over time).  

This method essentially says: “We’re insuring against the loss of future earnings,” giving a theoretical value to that person’s economic contribution to the family.

#### Layered Approach

Sometimes it’s strategic to combine different types of insurance (term and permanent) to cover multiple needs. For instance, you might recommend a large amount of term coverage to protect a mortgage or support children until they finish school. Then you layer on a smaller permanent policy to ensure there’s always a guaranteed amount for estate costs or final expenses.

Let’s visualize the process of aligning coverage with needs in a simple flowchart:

    C["Determine <br/>Insurance Type"] --> D["Implement <br/>Policy Mix"]
    D["Implement <br/>& Update"] --> E["Regularly <br/>Review"]
```

• “Conduct Fact-Find”: Gather all client information.  
• “Identify Coverage Requirements”: Pinpoint coverage amounts and durations.  
• “Determine Insurance Type”: Decide on term, permanent, or a blend.  
• “Implement Policy Mix”: Put the recommended policy (or policies) in place.  
• “Regularly Review”: Ensure the policy stays relevant as the client’s life changes.

### Life Insurance for Specific Needs

Life insurance can do a lot more than simply pay off a mortgage if the unthinkable happens. Let’s explore a few scenarios that commonly arise:

• Buy-Sell Agreements for Businesses: If your client co-owns a business, a life insurance policy can fund a buy-sell agreement should one owner die or become incapacitated. This arrangement allows the surviving owner to purchase the deceased’s share without burdening the company with massive debt.  
• Retirement Funding: Some permanent policies accumulate cash value and can be accessed later in life. While it’s not always the primary purpose, it’s an added benefit for clients looking to supplement retirement income.  
• Estate Tax or Final Expenses: Even though Canada doesn’t levy a direct estate tax, there may be tax liabilities upon death—especially for assets that have appreciated over time (e.g., cottages, stock portfolios). A life insurance lump sum can help heirs settle these costs without selling off assets at inopportune times.  

---

### Coordinating Existing Insurance Policies

A lot of Canadians have some form of group life coverage through their employers. While it might be tempting to rely solely on that, group coverage often isn’t enough to secure a family’s long-term needs. Plus, many group plans end or reduce in coverage when you leave or retire.

• Check Coverage Gaps: Compare the group coverage to the client’s total insurance need. You might find that only 30% or 40% of the needed amount is covered by the group plan.  
• Avoid Overlaps: If the group coverage is robust, consider smaller supplementary personal policies.  
• Portability Concerns: Employer-sponsored coverage usually can’t be taken if the client leaves the job. Having a personal policy ensures stability.

---

### Over-Insuring vs. Under-Insuring

It’s surprisingly easy to get this balance wrong. Over-insuring burdens the client with premiums that could be used for other financial goals (like paying down high-interest debt or boosting retirement savings). Under-insuring is equally risky: It can leave a family or a business dangerously exposed if a primary earner or key partner passes away.

How do you walk that line? Keep the fact-find accurate and ongoing. Revisit the plan regularly—at least annually or whenever a big life event happens (e.g., marriage, expansion of a business, the birth of a child).

---

### Potential Gaps and How Insurance Bridges Them

One of the most practical ways to paint the picture for your client is to illustrate the “what if” scenarios. If the client becomes severely ill or passes away, how are the following addressed?

• Daily living expenses (rent, groceries, utilities)  
• Mortgage or rent (especially in high-cost housing markets)  
• Children’s education (university tuition can be a major expense)  
• Final expenses (funeral costs, medical bills)  
• Estate or business continuity (avoid forced liquidation)  

The lump-sum payout from a life insurance policy can provide immediate liquidity, ensuring none of these obligations derail the family’s financial stability.

### Reviewing and Updating Policies

Policies aren’t static. Many life insurance contracts allow changes in coverage or riders (like critical illness or disability riders). Additionally, term policies can often be converted to permanent ones without fresh underwriting, a handy feature if a client’s health deteriorates but they now want life-long coverage.

• Timing: Some advisors recommend annual or biennial reviews. Life changes fast—one day your client is single, the next they’re married with kids on the way.  
• Adjusting Riders: Maybe a child rider can be added for a newborn, or a disability waiver can be removed if it’s no longer necessary.  
• Conversions: If your client’s priority shifts to estate preservation, converting an existing term policy to whole life or universal life might fit better.

---

### Documentation and Compliance

From a regulatory standpoint, it’s vital to document every step. If a gap is identified and the client chooses not to address it, note their decision. If coverage is recommended and accepted, detail the policy structure, premium, beneficiary designations, and so on.

• Signed Acknowledgements: Confirm the client fully understands the coverage details and limitations.  
• Regular Communication: Changes in health, job, or family status should be relayed so policies can be updated accordingly.  
• Official Guidelines: Check out provincial regulatory bodies like the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) for disclosure and suitability rules. CIRO provides national resources about best practices, while FP Canada (formerly the Financial Planning Standards Council) has ethical guidelines supporting client-centric decision-making.

### Case Study Example

Imagine a married couple, Sally and Mark, both 35 years old with two preschool children, a mortgage, and a small business. Sally makes $80,000 a year; Mark makes $60,000. They each have $100,000 worth of group life insurance through their employers.

• Fact-Find Observations: Mortgage is $300,000, monthly expenses ~$4,000, plus business obligations. They want to ensure the kids can attend university.  
• Coverage Calculation: Using a capital needs analysis, they estimate immediate cash needs of $600,000 if one person dies (mortgage, funeral, kids’ initial education). Considering ongoing monthly expenses, they decide each spouse needs ~$800,000 in total coverage.  
• Coordination with Group Coverage: They already have $100,000 from the group plan. So, they opt to buy an additional $700,000 of term life coverage each for the next 20 years.  
• Layering Approach: To take care of post-20-year needs (like final expenses and leaving a small legacy), they each add a $50,000 permanent policy.  
• Review Plan: Every 2–3 years, or if their income or liabilities change (e.g., paying off half the mortgage or selling the business), they’ll meet with their advisor.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• Be Realistic About Budgets: Insurance is crucial, but if premiums are too high, clients may drop the policy.  
• Address Rider Overload: Extra riders (like critical illness or disability) can be helpful but not if they bloat premiums unnecessarily.  
• Don’t Ignore Inflation: Future costs—particularly education—can be higher than today’s estimates.  
• Keep Beneficiary Designations Updated: Marriages, divorces, and births can shift who needs to be named on the policy.

- [ ] It splits costs evenly between two separate policies, making it cheaper. 
- [ ] It is only valid for single individuals with no dependants. 

> **Explanation:** By layering coverage, clients can protect both immediate liabilities (term insurance) and long-term needs (permanent insurance).

### What is the primary function of life insurance in a buy-sell agreement?
- [ ] To compensate employees in case of a layoff.
- [ ] To boost the policyholder’s credit when seeking a loan.
- [x] To fund the purchase of a deceased owner’s share in a business.
- [ ] To reduce mortgage rates on the company’s property.

> **Explanation:** A buy-sell agreement typically uses life insurance proceeds to buy out the deceased partner’s share, ensuring business continuity.

### Why is it essential to consider existing group coverage in your insurance analysis?
