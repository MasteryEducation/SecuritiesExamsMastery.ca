## 17.2 Taxation of Trusts

So, you’re thinking about trusts, right? Maybe you’re reviewing an estate plan, or perhaps you’re exploring ways to distribute investment income to family members. Well, let me tell you, trust taxation can be both fascinating and, occasionally, a bit intimidating. The good news is that with the right guidance, you can navigate the complexities, stay compliant with Canadian tax laws, and help your clients optimize their financial plans.

Trusts in Canada are subject to unique taxation rules that differ from personal or corporate taxation. And while trusts can be incredibly powerful for asset protection, estate planning, and wealth distribution, they also come with certain responsibilities—particularly in the realm of taxes. Let’s unpack the basics and delve into some specialized topics, from the 21-year deemed disposition rule to Qualified Disability Trusts (QDTs).

Before we begin, a quick little anecdote: I once helped a client set up a family trust to fund their grandchildren’s post-secondary education. Everything seemed smooth until we realized there was little clarity on how the trust’s income would be taxed once distributed to the kids. Ensuring proper documentation and timing of distributions became crucial. That experience taught me (and them!) the importance of understanding the nuances of trust taxation from the get-go.

### Overview of How Trusts Are Taxed

In simple terms, a trust is essentially a legal arrangement whereby one party (the trustee) holds property for the benefit of another (the beneficiary). But as soon as there’s income involved—like interest, dividends, or capital gains—the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has rules to ensure that money doesn’t slip through the cracks untaxed.

• Undistributed income. Generally, if the trust earns income but doesn’t distribute it to beneficiaries, that income is taxed in the trust at the highest marginal tax rate.  
• Distributed income. If the trust allocates or pays out income to beneficiaries, the beneficiaries get taxed according to their own personal tax rates (subject to certain exceptions and potential attribution rules).

For most folks, the second scenario is appealing if a beneficiary is in a lower tax bracket, because that can reduce the overall tax liability for the family unit. However, timing matters, and so do anti-avoidance rules like the “kiddie tax” (more on that later).

To visualize the basic flow of a trust arrangement, check out the following diagram:

    B --> C["Trustee <br/>(Manages Trust)"]
    C --> D["Beneficiaries <br/>(Receive Distributions)"]
```

In this structure, the settlor contributes assets to the trust, the trustee manages or invests those assets, and the beneficiaries receive income or capital distributions according to the trust agreement.

### Testamentary Trusts and the Shift to Highest Marginal Tax Rates

Historically, testamentary trusts (i.e., trusts created upon death, usually through a will) benefited from graduated tax rates, which made them an excellent tool for estate planning. But the rules have changed significantly in recent years.

Nowadays, most testamentary trusts pay tax at the highest marginal rate unless they qualify as a Qualified Disability Trust (QDT). This shift was introduced to prevent people from setting up multiple testamentary trusts to multiply personal tax credits and enjoy lower graduated rates. So, if you spot a testamentary trust that hasn’t been updated for a while, it might be time for a conversation about whether it still suits your client’s objectives.

#### Qualified Disability Trust (QDT)
A QDT is a testamentary trust that meets specific disability-related criteria, enabling the trust to still access graduated tax rates. Usually, this involves having a beneficiary who qualifies for the federal Disability Tax Credit. It’s a highly beneficial mechanism for providing ongoing support to individuals with disabilities without incurring punishing tax rates. However, keep in mind the trust must continually meet eligibility criteria to maintain QDT status.

### 21-Year Deemed Disposition Rule

Picture this: A trust holds an investment property for, say, 30 years, and its value has quadrupled in that time. Wouldn’t it be nice to hold onto it indefinitely, watching it grow without any capital gains liability? Well, not so fast—Canadian tax rules have a “21-year deemed disposition” rule for most inter vivos trusts (those set up during someone’s lifetime).

This rule deems the trust to have disposed of its capital property every 21 years at fair market value. In other words, the trust is forced (on paper at least) to “sell” and “rebuy” its property, triggering capital gains tax on any accrued gains. The idea here is to prevent indefinite deferral of capital gains. This rule can be a big deal for family trusts holding assets like real estate or shares in a private corporation over the long term.

• Planning. Effective 21-year rule planning might involve distributing assets out to the beneficiaries before the anniversary date, or using a “rollover” to another trust if permitted, or even crystallizing gains in a strategic manner.  
• Calendar reminders. One best practice is to keep track of crucial anniversaries. You don’t want to miss that 21-year date and be caught by surprise with a hefty tax bill.  
• Inter-family transitions. Some families use the 21-year refresh as a strategic time to pass assets on to the next generation, effectively cleansing built-up capital gains within the trust.

---

### Spousal or Common-Law Partner Trusts

Spousal trusts allow for a deferral of capital gains until the death of the surviving spouse (or another triggering event). It’s like hitting the pause button on paying taxes—but only while that spouse is still alive. Once they pass away, the trust is deemed to have disposed of the assets at fair market value, and any gains are realized.

Let’s say you have a client who wants to ensure their spouse can continue to live in the family home after their death. A spousal trust can hold that home, and the capital gains on the property won’t arise until the spouse dies. This approach gives surviving spouses security while deferring the tax hit for a future date.

### Family Trusts and Income Splitting

Many folks set up family trusts to distribute investment income among multiple family members, hoping to take advantage of lower marginal tax brackets for each member. The idea is simple: if you have a pool of beneficiaries, and each receives a share of the trust income, that income might be taxed at lower rates in their individual hands, rather than being taxed at the highest rate in the trust or in the hands of a single person earning a high income.

As interesting as that sounds, I have to say—watch out for anti-avoidance provisions. The particularly notorious ones are the “kiddie tax” rules, formally known as the “tax on split income” rules (TOSI). These rules target income splitting with minors and certain related-party arrangements. Essentially, if income is directed to a child under 18 (or another specified individual who doesn’t meet certain exceptions), it may be taxed at the highest marginal rate, negating the benefit of splitting.

• Kiddie tax. Applies to certain types of passive income (like dividends on shares in a family corporation) that minors receive (directly or indirectly) from persons related to them.  
• TOSI expansions. Over time, TOSI rules have broadened to apply to adults in certain circumstances as well, so you want to keep an eye on the relevant conditions.  
• Record-keeping. Thorough documentation about the trust’s purpose, and why distributions are made, can be essential if the CRA comes calling.

### Attribution Rules

Attribution rules can throw a wrench into well-intentioned arrangements. Picture a scenario where a parent gifts assets to a trust for the benefit of their child, hoping to shift income into their child’s lower tax bracket. If certain conditions aren’t met, the parent may end up “attributing” that income back to themselves. In other words, for tax purposes, it’s considered the parent’s income. These rules exist to prevent abuse of income splitting. They can be complex and vary depending on who’s transferring the property (spouse, parent, business partner, etc.) and what kind of income is being earned (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.).

---

### Practical Example: Timing of Distributions

Let’s look at a straightforward example. Suppose you’re the trustee of a family trust that earns $10,000 of interest income in a year. If you keep that $10,000 in the trust, it’ll typically be taxed at the highest marginal rate—let’s say around 50%, yielding a $5,000 tax bill. Ouch!

But if you distribute that $10,000 to two adult beneficiaries in lower tax brackets—each receiving $5,000—each beneficiary might pay, for example, only 20% tax on that amount, so $1,000 of tax each, totaling $2,000. The family collectively saves $3,000 in tax. That’s a big difference.

However, if those beneficiaries are minors or subject to TOSI rules, or if the original asset belonged to the parent and triggers attribution, you must evaluate whether the distribution truly lowers the overall tax burden. That is why seeking professional guidance is critical.

### Additional Tax Minimization Strategies

Below are a few strategies advisors often consider:

• Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE). If your trust holds shares of a qualified small business corporation (QSBC) and meets the criteria, beneficiaries could access the LCGE on disposition. This is advanced planning though, so it requires careful structuring.  
• Rolling assets out. Before the 21-year anniversary, rolling capital property out of the trust to beneficiaries on a tax-deferred basis can help avoid a big deemed disposition.  
• Triggering gains intentionally. Sometimes you might actually want to trigger a capital gain in a lower-tax year to take advantage of losses or lower marginal rates. This can be counterintuitive, but it’s a tool in the kit for advanced planning.  
• QDT election. Helping a trust for a disabled beneficiary maintain QDT status can provide powerful advantages over many years.

---

### Common Pitfalls and Challenges

• Missing the 21-year mark. If you forget to plan before the deemed disposition date, your clients could be stuck with a large and unexpected tax liability.  
• Overlooking the kiddie tax. Distributing income to minors might seem like a solution—until you realize it may just be taxed at the highest marginal rate anyway.  
• Poor record-keeping. If the CRA audits the trust, lacking proper documents (like trust declarations, meeting minutes, and distribution schedules) can wreak havoc.  
• Failing to update testamentary trusts. Many older testamentary trusts still assume they enjoy graduated tax rates. That might not be the case unless they are QDTs.  
• Attribution trap. Transferring property to a trust that doesn’t meet the exceptions can lead to the original owner paying all the tax on that income or capital gains.

---

### Best Practices for Advisors

• Maintain clear documentation. Keep trust deeds, distribution records, and meeting minutes well-organized.  
• Chart out critical dates. Ensure you track anniversaries, especially the 21-year mark.  
• Stay current on legislation. Trust taxation rules can shift. Keep an eye on the CRA’s official updates and the Income Tax Act sections relevant to trusts.  
• Collaborate with specialists. Call in tax accountants or lawyers if anything in the trust’s structure or operation is complex. Trust taxation can be intricate, so a second opinion often saves headaches (and money) down the line.  
• Communicate with beneficiaries. Make sure they understand their responsibilities, especially if they claim certain credits or exemptions based on trust distributions.

### The Role of CIRO

Today, the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) oversees investment dealers and mutual fund dealers across Canada, combining the functions of the now-defunct IIROC and MFDA. While CIRO’s main mandate is investor protection and market regulation (not trust taxation specifically), it’s still valuable for advisors to keep up to date with their guidelines and continuing education. That way, you ensure your client recommendations remain consistent with industry best practices and regulatory standards.

### Conclusion

Trusts can be powerful—allowing you, or your clients, to manage, grow, and distribute wealth for a wide range of needs, from education funding to ensuring ongoing care for disabled family members. But with that power comes complexity. High marginal rates on undistributed income, the 21-year deemed disposition rule, special conditions for spousal and testamentary trusts, and the ever-present attribution and kiddie tax rules mean there’s plenty to keep track of. 

At the end of the day, strategic foresight, meticulous record-keeping, and proper professional advice are the cornerstones of success in trust taxation. By staying informed about the rules and potential pitfalls—and by timing distributions carefully—you can help ensure the trust arrangement works in everyone’s best interest. Perhaps the best piece of advice: don’t hesitate to consult a tax professional or estate planning lawyer when trust structures become even a little bit complicated. The right advice at the right time can go a long way in preventing tax headaches down the road.

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which of the following statements best describes the taxation of undistributed income in a trust?

- [ ] It is always taxed at the lowest marginal rate.  
- [x] It is taxed at the highest marginal rate.  
- [ ] It is taxed at the beneficiaries’ average tax rates.  
- [ ] It is taxed at a single flat rate under 25%.  

> **Explanation:** Any undistributed income earned by a trust is usually taxed at the highest marginal rate. Distributions to beneficiaries are taxed in the beneficiaries’ hands at their respective marginal rates (subject to certain exceptions).

### What is the purpose of the 21-year deemed disposition rule?

- [x] It prevents indefinite deferral of capital gains within a trust.  
- [ ] It allows trusts to avoid capital gains entirely.  
- [ ] It provides a tax credit on distributed income.  
- [ ] It automatically qualifies the trust for lower tax rates.  

> **Explanation:** The 21-year disposition rule deems a trust to have disposed of and reacquired its capital property every 21 years. This provision ensures latent capital gains are eventually taxed, preventing endless tax deferral.

### Which type of trust may still benefit from graduated tax rates?

- [ ] An inter vivos family trust in most cases.  
- [x] A Qualified Disability Trust (QDT) meeting specific criteria.  
- [ ] Any testamentary trust created after 2016.  
- [ ] All spousal trusts automatically qualify for graduated rates.  

> **Explanation:** Most testamentary trusts are now taxed at the top marginal rate. However, if the trust qualifies as a Qualified Disability Trust (QDT), it can retain access to graduated tax rates under certain conditions.

### How can family trusts help with tax planning?

- [ ] By eliminating all forms of income tax for the settlor.  
- [x] By distributing income among beneficiaries who are in lower tax brackets.  
- [ ] By receiving special exemptions from all capital gains taxes.  
- [ ] By preventing the trust from filing any tax returns.  

> **Explanation:** Family trusts are often used to shift or distribute income to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets, potentially reducing the overall tax burden. However, they do not eliminate all taxes or exempt beneficiaries from filing.

### What is one key characteristic of a spousal or common-law partner trust?

- [x] It allows for deferral of capital gains until the spouse’s (or partner’s) death.  
- [ ] It automatically avoids the 21-year deemed disposition rule.  
- [x] It must use assets transferred from a third-party sibling to qualify.  
- [ ] It exempts the trust from paying any provincial taxes.  

> **Explanation:** In a spousal or common-law partner trust, unrealized capital gains on trust assets are generally deferred until the surviving spouse dies. However, the 21-year rule still applies to these trusts unless the spouse’s death happens earlier, at which point gains are realized.

### Which of the following best describes the kiddie tax?

- [x] It taxes certain types of income for minors at the highest marginal rate.  
- [ ] It provides a special tax credit for parents.  
- [ ] It does not apply to minors below the age of 15.  
- [ ] It reduces a trust’s overall tax liability.  

> **Explanation:** Kiddie tax (often referred to as “TOSI” for minors) is designed to discourage income splitting with minors by taxing certain types of passive income at the highest marginal rate.

### Under the attribution rules, a parent transferring assets to a trust for the benefit of their minor child might experience what outcome?

- [x] The income generated could be attributed back to the parent for tax purposes.  
- [ ] The child would file a separate tax return taxed at 0%.  
- [x] The trust would disappear upon the child reaching age 18.  
- [ ] The parent would be automatically exempt from paying taxes.  

> **Explanation:** Attribution rules often cause the income (or even some capital gains) earned from assets transferred to a trust for minor children to be taxed in the hands of the parent, negating the intended split.

### What is a common planning technique used prior to a trust’s 21-year anniversary?

- [x] Distributing or rolling out assets to beneficiaries to avoid a large capital gains tax event.  
- [ ] Automatically converting the trust into a corporation to avoid taxes.  
- [ ] Claiming the small business deduction on the trust’s income.  
- [ ] Eliminating the trustee role and transferring all powers to the beneficiaries.  

> **Explanation:** Often, advisors distribute or “roll out” assets to beneficiaries before the 21-year mark to avoid a large deemed disposition on capital property. This can mitigate some of the associated tax hit.

### Which organization is responsible for overseeing investment dealers and mutual fund dealers in Canada in the current 2025 environment?

- [x] CIRO (Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization).  
- [ ] MFDA (Mutual Fund Dealers Association)  
- [ ] IIROC (Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)  
- [ ] CIPF (Canadian Investor Protection Fund)  

> **Explanation:** MFDA and IIROC are now defunct and have been amalgamated into CIRO, which oversees investment dealers, mutual fund dealers, and market integrity on Canada’s equity and debt marketplaces.

### True or False: A family trust that distributes interest income to adult beneficiaries in lower tax brackets can reduce the family’s overall tax liability.

- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> **Explanation:** Splitting income among beneficiaries who pay tax at lower marginal rates can indeed reduce the overall tax burden, as long as the distributions do not trigger other tax rules (like TOSI or attribution).
