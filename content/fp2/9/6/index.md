## 9.6 Annuities

Sometimes, when I first heard of annuities, I thought it sounded a bit like throwing money into a black box and crossing my fingers for income later. But over time, I realized they’re actually a well-established tool designed to give people stable, predictable income—especially handy in retirement. Let’s walk through the details. I promise: by the end of this section, you’ll see why annuities are a big deal for many Canadians approaching their golden years.

An annuity is basically a contract you sign with an insurance company. You (the annuitant) give them a lump-sum amount of money—usually thousands of dollars, sometimes more—and in return, they promise to pay you an income stream for either a set period of time or for the rest of your life. That’s the simplest version. Now, let’s peel back the layers, because like most financial products, annuities get a bit more interesting (and sometimes complicated).

### What Are Annuities and Why Do They Matter?

The essence of an annuity revolves around longevity risk—you know, the chance that you’ll outlive your retirement savings. With traditional investments, there’s always a worry: “Will my nest egg last until I’m 90? 95? 100?” Annuities are like a safety net. Once you purchase a life annuity, the insurance company takes on the responsibility of paying you until you pass away. That can be a huge relief for folks who want predictable monthly (or quarterly) checks and who are more focused on security than on chasing aggressive market returns.

Truth be told, my uncle used to say that annuities bought him a decent night’s sleep after he retired because he no longer had to obsess about stock market swings. Sure, they’re not the adrenaline-packed ride that a high-return equity portfolio can give you. But if you just want to pay your bills and still enjoy a good dinner out, annuities can make sense.

### Types of Annuities

There’s more than one kind of annuity. Actually, there are several, each structured to meet a different financial goal or preference. Let’s look at the main ones, so you can figure out which meets your needs (or your client’s needs, if you’re an advisor).

#### Immediate Annuity
• With an immediate annuity, payments begin almost as soon as you deposit your lump sum. Usually, you make a single-payment premium, and the insurance company starts sending you income checks right away—or within a month or so.  
• This can be beneficial if you’ve just retired and want the annuity’s income immediately.  

A typical scenario might look like this: You turn 65, consolidate your savings, and put $200,000 toward an immediate annuity. Next month, you start getting a monthly payment of, say, $1,000 (the exact figures vary, of course, based on interest rates and your age). That’s it—fairly straightforward and quick.

#### Deferred Annuity
• If you don’t need the income right away, a deferred annuity might appeal to you. You pay a lump sum (or sometimes a series of contributions) in advance, and the income payments start at a later date—maybe when you’re 70 or 75.  
• During that waiting period (the deferral), your money can grow on a tax-deferred basis (subject to the constraints of Canadian tax legislation).

This is sort of like planting a seed and planning to harvest the crops later. You might choose a deferred annuity if you’re still working part-time or have other income sources that can tide you over until you’re fully retired. It’s about timing—collecting bigger returns or bigger income in exchange for waiting.

#### Fixed Annuity
• A fixed annuity offers a guaranteed, predetermined rate of return. You know exactly how much you’ll receive, either right away (if immediate) or in the future (if deferred).  
• The insurance company invests mostly in safe assets, so your growth is pretty stable.

If you’re the kind of person who absolutely hates the suspense of markets going up and down, you might love the fixed annuity path. The downside? Because you’re insulated from the volatility, your growth potential might be somewhat modest. Think of it like the difference between a stable bond investment vs. a riskier equity investment. With a fixed annuity, it’s stability over excitement.

#### Variable Annuity
• A variable annuity invests your money in underlying sub-accounts (often known as segregated funds in Canada). The returns hinge on how these investments perform.  
• Your payments may go up or down based on market conditions, though many insurers provide certain guarantees or floors to protect you if the market takes a dive, albeit with extra fees in some cases.

This is for those who still want a measure of market involvement for potentially higher returns, but with some insurance features. It’s definitely more complex. You’ll want to understand fees, possible contract conditions, and the level of risk you can stomach.

#### Term-Certain Annuity
• A term-certain annuity pays income for a specific number of years. If you die before the term is up, the payments continue to your beneficiary.  
• This type can be handy if you’re bridging income until, say, a certain date when you’ll collect another pension or if you have certain life events planned.

For instance, if you only need guaranteed income for 10 years before your Canada Pension Plan (CPP/QPP) kicks in or before some other event, a term-certain annuity might be perfect. It basically locks down a stable paycheck for that time frame.

#### Life Annuity
• A life annuity pays you for as long as you live. In many policies, you can also choose a guarantee period, which ensures that if you pass away relatively soon, payments continue to your beneficiary for the length of that guarantee.  
• If your biggest fear is outliving your money, this can be a powerful solution. However, if you pass away early, the insurer “wins,” so to speak. But that’s the trade-off: you’re effectively pooling the longevity risk with a bunch of other annuitants.

Some folks add a spouse or partner to the contract so that in the event the primary annuitant dies, the spouse still gets part or all of the annuity income for their lifetime. That’s often called a joint-life annuity.

### Visual Overview: The Annuity Flow

It can help to see a simplified diagram of how this all works. Below is a quick Mermaid.js diagram to illustrate the core flow of an annuity:

A["Annuitant's Lump Sum <br/>Payment"]
B["Insurance Company <br/>(Issues Annuity)"]
C["Periodic Income Stream <br/>for Annuitant"]

A --> B
B --> C
```

The arrows basically say it all: You give money to the insurance company, and in return, you receive a steady stream of payments. Different annuity types just tweak the details—how soon the payments start, how they’re calculated, and whether they continue for a fixed period or for life.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Annuities

Honestly, there’s no perfect financial product. Annuities come with their own set of perks and quirks:

• Advantages:  
  – Guaranteed Income: You’ll get paid on schedule, especially if it’s a fixed or life annuity.  
  – Predictability: While others might watch their portfolio jump around, you’ll know exactly (or roughly, if variable) how much is coming in.  
  – Peace of Mind: No more fear that you’ll run out of money if you live longer than expected (especially with a life annuity).  
  – Market Volatility Shield: If you opt for a fixed annuity, you’re not as emotionally tied to the Wall Street roller coaster.

• Disadvantages:  
  – Lack of Liquidity: Once you’ve handed over that lump sum, it’s basically locked in. Cashing out early is typically not an option or can incur steep penalties.  
  – Limited Potential for Massive Growth: If markets soar, you might regret not having invested in equities.  
  – Inflation Risk: Unless you purchase an inflation-adjusted annuity (which can be pricier), a fixed payment won’t keep pace with rising prices.  
  – Opportunity Cost: That money could possibly have earned more in other investments—though with higher risk, of course.

### Using Annuities to Bridge Retiree Income Gaps

Most Canadians have some combination of government benefits such as Old Age Security (OAS), the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) for lower-income retirees, and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). But sometimes, these benefits alone fall short of what retirees want in terms of monthly cash flow.

That’s where an annuity might come in. Maybe you’ll draw a small CPP but have a gap of, say, $1,200 a month to meet your everyday living costs. An annuity can fill that exact $1,200 gap so you’re no longer stressing about your budget. Or if you want a guaranteed income for your spouse should you pass away first, you might spring for a joint-life annuity or a single-life annuity with a guaranteed period.

### Real-World Example: A Couple Approaching Retirement

Imagine Kelly and Jordan, both aged 62. They each have modest RRSPs, plus Jordan is expecting a decent pension from his employer in a few years. Kelly doesn’t have a pension but has a small RRSP and some unregistered savings. They’re reading up on retirement planning and see that their monthly expenses come to $3,500, but their combined CPP/QPP and OAS will only cover $2,300. If they buy a life annuity using $200,000 from their RRSPs, they might secure around $1,200 (for example) in monthly income—enough to cover that gap for life. They sleep well knowing the mortgage and bills are handled no matter what happens in the stock market.

### Tax Considerations

In Canada, annuity taxation depends on whether you purchased it within a registered plan (like an RRSP or RRIF) or with non-registered funds:

• RRSP or RRIF Funds:  
  – If you take a portion of your RRSP and purchase an annuity, or convert your RRIF savings to an annuity, all annuity payments become taxable as ordinary income. Since your original contributions were tax-deferred, the entire payment is taxable at your marginal rate in the year you receive it.

• Non-Registered Funds:  
  – Here’s where it gets interesting. Only the interest portion of each payment is taxable. The initial principal you funded is considered a return of capital.  
  – You can also choose a “prescribed annuity,” which spreads the taxable interest portion more evenly throughout the payout period. This can level out your tax situation year over year.

Remember that taxes can cut into your total net income, so you want to plan carefully. Sometimes, folks stagger the purchase of multiple annuities to spread out taxes. Others might wait to buy an annuity until they retire and their marginal rate is lower. It’s worth having a conversation with a financial advisor.

### Best Practices, Common Pitfalls, and Strategies

• Best Practices:  
  – Shop Around: Annuity rates vary by provider, so it pays (literally) to get several quotes.  
  – Consider Longevity: If you have health factors that might reduce your lifespan, you may want to weigh whether a single-life annuity is right for you. For instance, an impaired life annuity could offer higher payouts if you have certain medical conditions.  
  – Combine with Other Products: Annuities don’t have to be your entire retirement plan. Pair them with TFSAs, RRIFs, or LIFs for balanced flexibility and guaranteed income.

• Common Pitfalls:  
  – Over-Allocation: Putting all your assets into an annuity limits liquidity. You might need some liquid savings for emergencies or growth.  
  – Overlooking Inflation: A fixed monthly amount might be great for the first 5–10 years, but inflation can erode buying power over 20 years.  
  – Not Reading the Fine Print: Make sure you understand any fees, surrender charges, or differences between variable annuity sub-accounts and guarantees.  

• Strategies to Overcome These Issues:  
  – Laddering: You could purchase multiple annuities at different ages, locking in higher rates over time.  
  – Joint vs. Single Annuities: If you’re concerned about providing for a spouse, consider a joint-life annuity or a guarantee period.  
  – Inflation-Protected Annuities: Some insurers offer annuities that increase payments with inflation. The initial payments might be smaller, but it protects your purchasing power in later years.

### A Quick Glance at Regulations and Oversight

Because annuities in Canada are offered by life insurance companies, they fall under both federal and provincial jurisdictions. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) supervises federally regulated insurers, while provinces regulate insurance products at the local level as well.

• OSFI (https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/): Keep an eye on OSFI guidelines for solvency and risk management requirements for insurers.  
• CIRO (https://www.ciro.ca/): Canada’s national self-regulatory organization overseeing investment dealers, mutual fund dealers, and market integrity. They also provide investor guides and can help you understand how insurance products fit into broader investment portfolios.  
• The Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF): Not specifically for insurance—CIPF is for investment dealer insolvencies—but it’s good to know who covers what. Annuities are insurance products and typically guaranteed (up to certain limits) by Assuris, not CIPF.  

If you’re using RRSP savings, check carefully for any associated rules from these regulatory bodies, as well as from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

• Case Study 1: Deferred Annuity for Late Retiree  
  – Maria is 60, working part-time, and wants to retire completely at 70. She invests $100,000 in a deferred annuity set to start paying her at 70. The insurance company invests her premium, and by the time Maria is 70, her monthly payment is higher than it would have been at 60. This works out perfectly for her because it aligns with her timeline.

• Case Study 2: Term-Certain Annuity for Bridging  
  – Vishal anticipates a company pension starting at age 65. But he’s retiring at 60! He buys a 5-year term-certain annuity to cover that gap. The annuity ends once his pension starts—and if he passes away before 65, the remaining payments go to his beneficiary.  

• Case Study 3: Life Annuity with Spousal Continuation  
  – Elaine and Sam want to make sure that whichever one survives has enough income. They opt for a joint-life annuity. The payments continue at 100% to the surviving spouse, ensuring that both remain financially secure no matter who outlives whom.

### Glossary

• Annuitant: The person on whose life the annuity is based. If the annuitant passes away in a life annuity, the payments end (unless there’s a guarantee or joint option).  
• Guaranteed Period: An optional feature that keeps payments going to a beneficiary for a set number of years if the annuitant dies early.  
• Prescribed Annuity: A non-registered annuity type where taxes on the interest portion are spread evenly over the term, avoiding big spikes in taxable income.  
• Segregated Funds: Insurance-based investments (some call them “mutual funds with an insurance wrapper”). Variable annuities often use them to provide a blend of market growth potential and certain guarantees.

### Putting It All Together

Now that we’ve laid out all these details, you might wonder how to fit annuities into a broader retirement plan. Honestly, the best approach is a mix of guaranteed income (like annuities or pension plans) plus flexible, growth-oriented accounts (such as TFSAs, RRIFs, or non-registered investments) to keep pace with inflation and unforeseen expenses. Annuities shine when you want absolute certainty of income—particularly for covering the basics of living expenses.

If you’re a financial planner, you’ll weigh each client’s goals and risk appetite before recommending an annuity. If you’re an individual investor, you’ll want to consider your personal time horizon, any legacy planning goals, your spouse’s needs, and your comfort with market volatility. Maybe speak with a qualified insurance specialist to get a sense of the specific rates and features on offer.

Remember: The biggest thing annuities bring is that intangible peace of mind. When you retire, that can matter a whole lot more than an extra percentage point in potential market returns—especially if you wake up each day not worried about your stock holdings.

Take your time, do your research, and you’ll soon discover whether an annuity is the missing puzzle piece in your overall retirement strategy.
