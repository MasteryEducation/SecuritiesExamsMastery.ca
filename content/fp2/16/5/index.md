## 16.5 Impact of Divorce on a Client’s Financial Plan

Divorce can shake the foundations of even the most carefully constructed financial plan. If you’ve ever watched friends go through the breakup of a marriage, you might have noticed that everything from bank accounts to life goals can be thrown into confusion. Sometimes people feel like the rug has been pulled out from under them, and it’s the job of a financial planner to help them reestablish their footing. 

Below, we’ll explore the primary ways that divorce affects all aspects of a client’s financial life—from the sudden jolt to cash flow and insurance needs, to the complex tax issues that can arise. We’ll also chat about how to adjust estate documents, beneficiary designations, and budgeting tools to ensure clients stay on track toward their goals, even if those goals shift dramatically. 

In a nutshell, our job is to help clients move from that anxious “What now?” feeling to a place where they understand their new financial reality and can plan accordingly.


## Key Considerations After Divorce

### Updating or Creating a Comprehensive Financial Plan
It’s common for folks in the midst of a divorce to focus on the immediate crisis and not realize that virtually every part of their financial plan may need to be revisited. This includes:

• Revising the net worth statement: Jointly held assets are often divided, and certain debts may be assigned to one spouse. Suddenly, that tidy net worth figure needs recalculating.  
• Reassessing risk tolerance: Clients often find their appetite for risk may change if they no longer have a second household income or if they anticipate large legal fees or settlement costs.  
• Recalibrating short- and long-term goals: Maybe the dream of an early retirement shifts to a more conservative timeline now that the client is a single income earner.  

A practical approach: Start by reviewing every item in the existing financial plan with the client—like a checklist. Go through cash flow, insurance coverage, investments, and estate documents. Update each section to reflect the new situation.


### Reassessing Lifestyle and Goals
Divorce can mean a fundamental lifestyle change. If you’ve ever had that moment where you look at your monthly budget and think, “Oh, wait, I have to manage this all by myself now?,” you’ll understand:

• Retirement timelines: Clients may need to push back their retirement date due to division of assets or additional expenses like spousal and child support.  
• Housing expectations: Some individuals choose to downsize their living situation, particularly if moving from a two-income household to a single. Others must buy out an ex-spouse’s share of the home.  
• Child and spousal support obligations: When a client is the one paying support, it’s crucial to factor those payments into the cash flow. On the other side, if they’re receiving support, it might allow them to maintain a semblance of their pre-divorce standard of living, although the reliability and duration of that support matter for budgeting.  

Encourage clients to articulate new personal goals, whether that’s saving for their child’s education or traveling once they have more emotional bandwidth. Those reimagined goals can be the backbone of an updated financial plan.


### Reviewing Existing Insurance Policies
Here’s a biggie that people sometimes overlook. When divorce happens, existing insurance coverage might no longer suit their needs or—worse—could still name an ex-spouse as beneficiary when that’s not the client’s intention anymore. So, what should be reviewed?

• Life insurance: Confirm beneficiary designations. If a client still wants an ex-spouse to have the payout for the sake of children, that’s fine. But if not, they should consider naming a new beneficiary.  
• Disability and critical illness insurance: Evaluate coverage levels. A single person might require more robust disability coverage if they no longer share household expenses, or perhaps less coverage if they are receiving spousal support.  
• Confirm beneficiary clauses in group plans: Many employer-sponsored or group plans require a formal update to reflect changes in marital status.  

A simple phone call or email to the client’s insurance representative, or an internal review of which coverage is in place, can prevent erroneously paid benefits and ensure proper coverage moving forward.


### Evaluating Tax Implications
When property is divided or spousal support is paid, tax consequences often lurk behind the scenes. A well-intentioned property transfer could inadvertently trigger capital gains if not done correctly. Or a spouse might overlook the tax treatment of support obligations (e.g., paying spousal support might be deductible, while paying child support typically is not).

• Property transfers between spouses: In many cases, property can be transferred at cost base under Canada’s Income Tax Act, provided certain conditions are met. If a client inadvertently sells the property to an ex-spouse at fair market value instead of transferring it, they might face capital gains unexpectedly.  
• Spousal support deductibility: Clients who pay spousal support typically can deduct those amounts. Meanwhile, recipients generally include spousal support in their income, which may lower or increase their taxes (depending on their bracket). Child support, however, is usually not deductible for the payer nor taxable for the recipient.  
• Changes to child benefits: When custody arrangements shift, so can eligibility for certain child tax benefits. Encourage clients to update the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) accordingly to avoid overpayments or underpayments.  

For more detailed guidance, clients can consult CRA resources (https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html), or you, as a planner, can collaborate with a tax professional to make sure everything is done by the book.


### Adjusting Estate Planning Documents
It might be nerve-wracking to talk about estate planning during an already tense period, but ignoring it can be disastrous if something should happen. Documents to check:

• Wills: Many individuals update their will right after divorce to ensure that their ex-spouse is not inadvertently inheriting everything.  
• Beneficiary designations: Registered accounts (RRSPs, TFSAs) and life insurance often pass directly to the named beneficiary, regardless of the will. If that beneficiary is an ex, the client may want to make changes—unless those arrangements remain part of a legal settlement.  
• Power of attorney (POA) documents: If the client had named the spouse as attorney for property or personal care, a replacement needs to be decided.  

Check the local provincial laws on how separation or divorce automatically (or does not automatically) affect wills and beneficiary designations. Some provinces in Canada automatically revoke the spouse as executor or beneficiary once a divorce is final, but the specifics can be tricky. Clients should consult with an estate lawyer or notary for clarity.


### Coordinating with Other Professionals
No advisor is an island, right? You might find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with lawyers, accountants, or therapists, all helping the client navigate the complexities of divorce.

• Legal support: Family law is nuanced. If you’re not a legal professional, the best route is to let a qualified lawyer handle property division while you provide accurate financial data and clarity on values.  
• Accounting or tax specialists: Particularly when spousal support payments intersect with complex investment portfolios or small business ownership, a simple oversight can prove costly.  
• Emotional support professionals: Divorce can be emotionally taxing, so clients might disengage from the planning process. A mental health counselor or divorce coach can help them maintain focus.  

In many divorces, each professional’s input weaves together: lawyers ensure fair settlements, accountants limit tax consequences, and financial planners keep the big picture in view so that new goals remain feasible.


## Practical Steps for Navigating Divorce Financials

Below is a quick, high-level overview of how the divorce process typically intersects with finances. It might help you visualize the journey from “shared finances” to “separate finances” at a glance:

    B["Divorce Proceedings <br/>(Legal & Financial Disclosure)"]
    C["Settlement <br/> (Support, Property Division)"]
    D["Post-Divorce <br/>Financial Plan"]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
```

• Step 1—Identify the starting status (A): The couple’s combined net worth statement, joint obligations, and shared goals.  
• Step 2—Proceed with legal disclosure (B): Lawyers, in conjunction with financial planners, gather data on assets, debts, income, and expenses.  
• Step 3—Negotiate settlement terms (C): Decide how to split property, who pays spousal or child support, and any other obligations.  
• Step 4—Rebuild the financial plan (D): Incorporate the settlement terms, realign goals, and set up new strategies post-divorce.


## Best Practices and Pitfalls

• Be precise: Incomplete financial disclosure can lead to a settlement that unravels later if hidden assets are discovered.  
• Keep an eye on debts: Joint debts remain “joint” in the eyes of creditors. If the ex doesn’t pay a debt they assumed in the settlement, it might still come back on the other spouse.  
• Don’t ignore insurance: Divorce decrees sometimes require certain life insurance policies remain in force if there’s a spousal or child support obligation.  
• Communicate clearly about support obligations: Late or missed support payments can cause financial stress and legal implications. Build them into the client’s budget.  
• Factor in inflation: If the divorce settlement states spousal support is a fixed amount, it might not keep pace with the cost of living. Think about indexing or reevaluating in a few years.  

I’ve seen clients breathe a massive sigh of relief after going through a thorough financial review—it’s like they can finally see a clear path forward, and that clarity alone reduces stress and uncertainty.

## Practical Example

Let’s consider a quick scenario: Alice and Bob got married in their late 20s and are now divorcing in their mid-40s. During their marriage, they invested in a family home, contributed to RRSPs, and had a robust travel budget. Bob started a small business, and Alice accrued pension benefits through work.

• Step 1: Financial Disclosure – Alice and Bob must list out all assets and debts, including the value of Bob’s business and Alice’s pension. This involves possibly hiring a professional valuator.  
• Step 2: Settlement – They agree that Bob will keep the business, and Alice will retain a larger share of the home equity. Bob will buy out part of Alice’s interest in the business. Because they have two kids, Bob also pays child support.  
• Step 3: Tax Ramifications – Bob’s business distribution might trigger capital gains if not structured properly. Alice could move out of the marital home and face changes in her primary residence exemption if she keeps other properties. They consult a tax lawyer to minimize potential liabilities.  
• Step 4: Post-Divorce Planning – Alice updates her RRSP beneficiary to her sister. She pushes her retirement date by two years to offset a smaller investment portfolio. Bob invests in disability insurance to protect his business income, now that he doesn’t have the extra safety net of a two-income household.  

This scenario illustrates how everything—cash flow, risk protection, tax, estate planning, and lifestyle expectations—must be addressed after a marital breakdown.


## Concluding Thoughts

Divorce is emotional. And finances? They’re emotional, too. They embody our future dreams, security, and sometimes a sense of who we are. So when you combine them, things can get overwhelming and stressful. But with a proactive, systematic approach—one that calls on the right professionals and uses transparent financial disclosure—clients can find their way to a new equilibrium.

It’s all about giving clients clarity: What do they have? What do they owe? How does this affect their goals, such as retirement savings or supporting kids’ education? And, crucially, how do they pivot their plans when the unexpected happens?

Remember: You’re not just helping someone navigate numbers on a spreadsheet. You’re helping them secure their future in a changed circumstance. Sure, it’s a challenge. But it’s also an opportunity for a client to redesign their life’s financial architecture in a way that might ultimately serve them better.
