# CPH® (Conduct and Practices Handbook) Course

## Your Path to Professional Standards in the Canadian Securities Industry

The Conduct and Practices Handbook (CPH) is a crucial step for anyone seeking to register with the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) or comply with Canada's robust provincial securities regulations. This guide provides clear, thorough explanations of rules, ethical guidelines, and best practices—empowering you to align with the highest professional standards and client protection mandates.

### What Makes This Resource Stand Out?

1. **Straightforward Explanations**  
   We break down the most complex CIRO rules and provincial requirements into digestible sections. Gain the clarity you need to master compliance, suitability, and disclosure obligations without feeling overwhelmed.

2. **10 FREE Sample Questions per Page**  
   Practice is core to understanding the intricacies of Canadian securities regulations. Each page includes scenario‐based questions reflecting real exam challenges—reinforcing your learning step by step.

3. **Extensive Quiz Bank**  
   Strengthen your knowledge with thousands of additional quizzes covering everything from registration categories and ethical codes to know‐your‐client (KYC) procedures and handling of confidential information.

4. **Community-Driven & Open Source**  
   Our collaborative approach ensures that the information is always up‐to‐date and vetted by industry peers. You’re welcome to contribute real‐life examples, clarify new guidelines, or expand on any section via GitHub.

## Topics Covered

- Compliance Frameworks (reporting, record keeping, operational controls)

Each chapter is broken into succinct topics so you can strategically focus your study.
