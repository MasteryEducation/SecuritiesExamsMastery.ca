## Prohibited Activities: Protecting Market Integrity and Investor Trust

Okay, let's get real for a second. Imagine you're at a poker game, and one player secretly knows everyone's cards. Not exactly fair, right? Well, the financial markets aren't much different. To keep things fair and transparent, CIRO (Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization) explicitly prohibits certain trading practices. These prohibited activities can seriously undermine market integrity, investor confidence, and, frankly, your career. Let's dive into these practices, understand why they're problematic, and learn how to steer clear of trouble.

## Insider Trading: The Ultimate No-No

Insider trading is probably the best-known prohibited activity. It's basically trading securities based on material, non-public information. "Material" means information that could significantly affect the price of a security. Think about it: if you knew a company was about to announce a groundbreaking product or a disastrous quarterly loss before anyone else, you could make a killing—or avoid a huge loss. But that's cheating, plain and simple.

### Real-Life Example:

Remember Martha Stewart? Yep, the famous lifestyle guru. She got caught up in an insider trading scandal back in 2004. Stewart sold shares of ImClone Systems after receiving non-public information about an FDA rejection. She avoided a loss, but ended up serving jail time and paying hefty fines. Not exactly a good look.

### Consequences of Insider Trading:

- Severe financial penalties
- Criminal charges, including imprisonment
- Permanent damage to your professional reputation
- CIRO disciplinary actions, including suspension or permanent ban from the industry

## Market Manipulation: Playing Dirty Tricks

Market manipulation involves deceptive practices designed to artificially inflate or deflate securities prices. It's like rigging the game to your advantage—totally unethical and illegal. Common forms include:

- **Wash Trading:** Buying and selling the same security simultaneously to create artificial trading volume.
- **Spoofing:** Placing fake orders to create false impressions of market demand or supply.
- **Pump-and-Dump Schemes:** Hyping up a stock through misleading statements, then selling once the price spikes.

### Example of Pump-and-Dump:

Say a group of traders starts spreading false rumors online about a small biotech company claiming they've found a miracle cure. Investors rush in, driving the price sky-high. The manipulators then sell their shares at inflated prices, leaving innocent investors holding worthless stock when the truth comes out. Ouch.

## Front Running: Jumping the Queue

Front running is when a representative trades ahead of client orders based on advance knowledge of pending transactions. Imagine your client wants to buy a large block of shares. Knowing this will likely push the price up, you quickly buy shares for yourself first. When your client's order executes, the price rises, and you profit unfairly. Not cool.

CIRO takes front running seriously because it directly undermines client trust and market fairness.

### Front Running Example:

Let's say you're a registered representative, and your client instructs you to buy 100,000 shares of XYZ Corp. You anticipate this large order will push the stock price higher. So, you secretly purchase 10,000 shares for your personal account first. After executing your client's order, the stock price indeed rises, and you sell your shares for a quick profit. This unethical practice is strictly prohibited by CIRO.

## Churning: Trading for Commissions, Not Clients

Churning refers to excessive trading in a client's account primarily to generate commissions, without regard to the client's investment objectives or interests. It's like a mechanic charging you for repairs you don't need—just to pad their wallet.

### Signs of Churning:

- Frequent buying and selling without clear investment rationale
- High turnover rates in the client's account
- Excessive commissions relative to account size

### Example of Churning:

Imagine a senior citizen with a conservative investment profile. Their advisor repeatedly buys and sells high-risk stocks, generating hefty commissions but providing no real benefit to the client. Eventually, the client's portfolio suffers significant losses, while the advisor pockets large commissions. This unethical practice can lead to severe penalties and loss of professional credibility.

## Unauthorized Trading: Going Rogue

Unauthorized trading occurs when a representative executes trades without explicit client authorization or beyond the scope of client instructions. It's like ordering food for someone without asking—except way more serious.

### Preventing Unauthorized Trading:

- Always obtain clear, documented client authorization before executing trades.
- Regularly confirm client instructions and investment objectives.
- Maintain accurate records of all communications and authorizations.

## Reporting Suspicious Activities: Speak Up!

If you suspect any prohibited activities or breaches of conduct, it's your duty to report them immediately to your firm's compliance department and, if necessary, CIRO. Staying silent isn't an option—your integrity and reputation depend on it.

Here's a quick visual guide on reporting:
