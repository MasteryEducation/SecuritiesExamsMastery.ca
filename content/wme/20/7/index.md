## 20.7 Equity Strategy

### Introduction
Equity strategy encompasses the methods and approaches used by investors or portfolio managers to select and manage equity securities (stocks) in pursuit of goals such as capital appreciation, income generation, and portfolio diversification. In Canada, the equity market ecosystem includes major exchanges such as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), regulatory bodies like the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), along with unique features like the dividend tax credit and specialized products for tax-advantaged investing.

Constructing a sound equity strategy requires aligning investment decisions with a client’s risk tolerance, time horizon, and long-term objectives. Advisors must also consider regulatory requirements under CIRO when recommending strategies, from suitability guidelines to ongoing portfolio monitoring.

Below, we explore four core strategic styles—growth, value, dividend, and index (passive)—alongside tactical asset allocation approaches, performance measurement considerations, and Canadian market insights to help you build or refine an equity strategy for a robust and sustainable portfolio.

### Key Equity Investing Strategies

#### Growth Investing
Growth investing focuses on companies with the potential for rapid revenue expansion, above-average earnings growth, or disruptive innovations. Growth stocks often trade at higher price multiples (e.g., P/E or PEG ratios) due to optimistic expectations of future performance and reinvested earnings rather than substantial dividend payouts.

• Common characteristics of growth companies:  
  - High revenue or earnings growth rates relative to market averages  
  - Reinvestment of profits into expansion (e.g., research & development, acquisitions)  
  - Possible emphasis on leading-edge technology or emerging sectors  

• Real-world Canadian examples:
  - Many tech-oriented companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange showcase strong growth characteristics.  
  - Pension funds (e.g., Canada Pension Plan Investment Board – CPPIB) often invest in Canada’s growing technology and healthcare companies, expecting long-term capital appreciation.

• Tax considerations in Canada:
  - Gains from the sale of growth stocks are subject to capital gains tax; 50% of the capital gain is included in taxable income as per Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules.  
  - Shorter holding periods can lead to higher turnover and increased realized capital gains, potentially reducing tax-efficiency.

#### Value Investing
Value investing involves identifying undervalued companies trading below their intrinsic or fair value. Practitioners often rely on fundamental analysis, focusing on metrics such as low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book (P/B) ratios, and robust free cash flow.

• Core principles:  
  - Buy undervalued securities with a “margin of safety”  
  - Assess intrinsic value via in-depth fundamental research  
  - Seek catalysts that may unlock a stock’s undervaluation  

• Canadian value examples:
  - Major banks like RBC, TD, and BMO often exhibit value traits when trading at lower-than-historical valuations, especially during periods of market turbulence.  
  - The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, a frequently cited classic, remains central to value investing philosophy.

• Regulatory considerations:
  - Advisors registered under CIRO must ensure that recommended value-oriented products align with a client’s risk profile.  
  - Disclosure requirements regarding company fundamentals are covered under CSA rules, providing transparency for fundamental analysts.

#### Dividend Investing
Dividend investing targets companies that provide consistent or growing dividend payouts, catering to investors seeking regular income and stability. Dividends can also be a signal of corporate health and stewardship.

• Key attributes:  
  - Steady cash dividends, potentially with a history of dividend growth  
  - Typically seen in mature industries or major financial institutions  
  - Possible lower price volatility compared to high-growth stocks  

• Canadian perspective:
  - Many large Canadian firms, especially banks (e.g., RBC, BMO, and TD), utility firms (like Fortis Inc.), and telecom giants (e.g., BCE), are known for reliable dividend distribution.  
  - Dividend tax credit: Canadian investors benefit from favorable tax treatment on eligible Canadian dividends, lowering their effective tax rate.

• Risks and considerations:
  - Over-reliance on dividends could lead to concentration in a few sectors.  
  - Dividend cuts can significantly impact an investor’s income stream and sentiment.

#### Index (Passive) Investing
Index or passive investing seeks to replicate the performance of a market index rather than outperform it. This approach is popular among cost-conscious investors and institutions looking for broad diversification.

• Common indices in Canada:
  - S&P/TSX Composite Index: A benchmark comprising a large portion of the TSX market capitalization.  
  - S&P/TSX 60: A narrower list of 60 large-cap companies, used frequently for index-based funds.

• Vehicles for index investing:
  - ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), governed by CSA’s National Instruments 81-101 and 81-102.  
  - Mutual funds tracking major Canadian or global indices (also subject to NI 81-101 and 81-102).

• Benefits:
  - Lower management fees compared to actively managed funds.  
  - Broad market exposure reduces idiosyncratic (company-specific) risk.

• Challenges:
  - No potential for outperformance if markets rise or decline.  
  - Investors remain fully exposed to market volatility.

### Combining and Balancing Strategies
Investors often mix various equity strategies—such as holding a core index fund position while complementing it with growth or value stocks—to balance risk and optimize returns. This blended approach can enhance diversification by spreading holdings across multiple distinct philosophies.

Additionally, in practice, many Canadian advisors might couple equity strategies with other asset classes such as bonds, REITs, or alternative investments to further dampen portfolio volatility. This balanced mix is particularly evident in large pension funds (e.g., Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan) which employ both active and passive equity allocations alongside alternative assets.

---

### Tactical Asset Allocation
Tactical asset allocation (TAA) involves making short-term shifts in a portfolio to exploit perceived market inefficiencies or predictive economic signals. Common TAA approaches include:

1. Sector rotation: Overweight or underweight specific sectors (e.g., energy, financials) based on macroeconomic trends or changes in interest rates.  
2. Style rotation: Alternating emphasis between growth and value styles in response to changing market or economic cycles.  
3. Momentum strategies: Focusing on stocks with strong recent performance, hoping for continued upward moves in price.

Although TAA can generate alpha, it also raises trading costs and complexity. Advisors must ensure TAA decisions remain suitable for clients under CIRO’s regulatory guidance, reflecting each investor’s profile and preferences.

### Performance Measurement
Measuring the success of an equity strategy goes beyond raw returns. Key metrics include:

- **Volatility (Standard Deviation):** Evaluates the dispersion of returns. Higher volatility generally implies higher risk.  
- **Beta:** Measures an investment’s sensitivity to market movements. A beta above 1.0 suggests the security or portfolio is more volatile than the market.  
- **Drawdown:** Represents peak-to-trough losses over a specified period. Monitoring drawdowns helps investors assess downside risk and resilience.  
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Common benchmarks for Canadian equities include the S&P/TSX Composite or specialized sector indices. Returns are often expressed on a risk-adjusted basis (e.g., Sharpe Ratio).

Regular performance appraisals, coupled with compliance processes under CIRO rules, help verify that portfolio decisions align with stated objectives and client expectations.

---

### Regulatory Considerations
When implementing any equity strategy in Canada, you must remain aware of:

- **CIRO Requirements:** CIRO is the national self-regulatory body overseeing investment dealers and mutual fund dealers. It emphasizes suitability, disclosure, and ongoing monitoring of portfolios.  
- **CSA’s National Instruments 81-101 and 81-102:** Provide rules around prospectus disclosure and the operational framework for mutual funds and ETFs.  
- **CIPF Coverage:** Protects client assets if a CIRO member firm fails, ensuring a measure of security for Canadian investors.

Being conversant with these regulations helps advisors uphold professional standards and protect client interests.

### Summary
Equity strategy is an essential pillar of wealth management, requiring a balanced synthesis of growth, value, dividend, and index approaches. Canadian investors benefit from specific market features such as dividend tax credits and a supportive regulatory framework. However, risk tolerance, time horizon, and personal goals remain paramount considerations in selecting or tweaking an equity strategy.

While passive investing offers simplicity and lower fees, active strategies can seek to exploit market inefficiencies or rotation opportunities. Continuous performance monitoring, appropriate regulatory compliance, and strategic use of professional-grade tools ensure that portfolios stay aligned with clients’ long-term financial aspirations.

By understanding the breadth of equity strategies and how they interact with market cycles, tax rules, and regulations, advisors empower clients to navigate the Canadian equity market effectively and responsibly.
