## 15.3 Probate Procedures to Validate a Will

Probate is a critical legal step in estate administration. It ensures that a will is valid and that the named executor (or estate trustee) has legal authority to act on behalf of the deceased’s estate. In Canada, probate rules and fees vary among provinces and territories, but the overarching goal is to safeguard beneficiaries, creditors, and the integrity of the estate. Below is a comprehensive overview of probate procedures, key steps in validating a will, and considerations for advisors and executors.

## Understanding the Purpose of Probate

Probate serves two main purposes:

1. It legally affirms that the will submitted to the court is the deceased’s true last will and testament. 
2. It officially confirms the executor’s authority to administer the estate (e.g., through a Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee in Ontario).

While some assets may pass directly to beneficiaries outside of probate (e.g., assets held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, life insurance proceeds with designated beneficiaries, or certain registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) with named beneficiaries), many estates still require a formal probate application to address remaining assets and debts.

## Key Steps in the Probate Process

Though each province has unique procedures and terminology, the following steps generally apply across Canada:

### 1. File the Will in Court

• The executor submits a formal application for probate (often called an “Application for a Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee” in Ontario).  
• Court forms and guidelines are available from provincial courts (e.g., [Ontario Court Forms](http://ontariocourtforms.on.ca/en/rules-of-civil-procedure-forms)).  
• The executor may need to provide an executor’s bond (also known as a fiduciary bond), unless waived by the court. This bond helps protect beneficiaries and creditors from mismanagement.

### 2. Pay Probate Fees or Estate Administration Taxes

• Each province or territory charges probate fees or estate administration taxes, which are often calculated as a percentage of the estate’s fair market value. For example, in Ontario, the first $50,000 of the estate’s value is taxed at 0.5%, and the remainder is taxed at 1.5%.  
• The executor must pay these fees from the estate’s funds before receiving the Certificate of Appointment.

### 3. Notify Beneficiaries and Creditors

• Depending on local rules, the executor is required to officially notify all known beneficiaries and creditors.  
• A creditor notice is typically published in a local paper or other recognized medium, giving creditors the opportunity to present claims against the estate.

### 4. Gather and Inventory Assets and Liabilities

• The executor compiles a complete list of the estate’s assets and debts, including real estate, personal property, investment accounts, and liabilities such as outstanding loans or taxes.  
• Accuracy is crucial: provincial authorities, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and beneficiaries rely on this inventory to understand the estate’s financial position.

### 5. Settle Debts and Taxes

• Before distributing any inheritance, the executor must ensure that all legitimate debts, funeral expenses, and taxes (including income tax and, if applicable, provincial estate taxes) are paid.  
• Failure to settle these obligations properly can result in personal liability for the executor.

### 6. Distribute Remaining Assets

• Once the estate has paid required fees, debts, and taxes, the executor follows the instructions in the will to distribute the remaining assets to named beneficiaries.  
• If any disputes or challenges arise (e.g., questions on the authenticity of the will or the deceased’s capacity), final distribution may be delayed until the matter is resolved.

## Multiple Wills to Minimize Probate Fees

In some provinces, particularly Ontario, using multiple wills can be an effective estate planning strategy to reduce probate fees. One will might govern assets that must go through probate (e.g., real estate titled solely in the deceased’s name), while the second will might govern assets such as private company shares. This approach can reduce the portion of the estate subject to probate taxes. However, implementing multiple wills requires professional legal advice and careful drafting to avoid contradictions or confusion.

---

## Common Challenges and Disputes

• **Authenticity Challenges:** If the will’s validity is contested—perhaps due to questions about the testator’s mental capacity—probate can be delayed. Courts may require evidence such as medical records or witnesses’ testimonies.  
• **Multiple Wills in Conflict:** If the deceased left multiple signed wills without clear delineation of assets, the court may need to determine device priority or whether a later will revoked an earlier one.  
• **Executor’s Bond:** Courts sometimes require a fiduciary bond to protect beneficiaries. The bond can be costly or difficult to obtain if the executor’s personal circumstances are complex.  
• **Cross-Border Estates:** Estates that include assets in multiple jurisdictions can complicate probate further. Additional legal processes may be necessary outside Canada, so advisors commonly refer cross-border estates to specialized trust companies (e.g., RBC Royal Trust, TD Wealth Private Trust) or estate lawyers with multinational experience.

## How Advisors Can Assist

Financial professionals and wealth advisors can play several essential roles during probate:

1. **Coordinate with Specialists:** Advisors often recommend estate lawyers or trust companies when legal or administrative complexities arise.  
2. **Facilitate Asset Discovery:** Advisors can help compile the deceased’s financial records and valuations of securities or real estate holdings.  
3. **Manage Liquidity Needs:** Executors may require access to funds (e.g., from investment accounts) to pay taxes and other obligations. Advisors can help determine optimal strategies for liquidating assets.  
4. **Post-Probate Planning:** Once probate is granted, advisors can assist beneficiaries in reallocating inherited assets, aligning them with personal financial goals and risk profiles.

## Real-World Example: Probate and Major Canadian Banks

• Many Canadian estates, especially those holding accounts with large banks (e.g., RBC, TD, BMO), require confirmation of the executor’s authority via a probate certificate before releasing funds to settle liabilities or proceed with distributions.  
• Canadian banks often have internal estate settlement divisions that guide executors step-by-step, coordinating with the legal system to ensure compliance with provincial rules.  
• In complex scenarios, RBC Royal Trust or BMO Trust Company may be engaged to serve as a corporate executor, handling all probate documents, verification, and distribution on behalf of the estate.

## Diagrams: The Probate Timeline

Below is a simplified flowchart illustrating the typical probate timeline from the moment estate administration begins until final distribution:

In this diagram:  
• The process starts when the testator (will-maker) passes away.  
• The executor gathers documents (including the will, asset statements, etc.).  
• After filing for probate and paying fees, the executor notifies beneficiaries and creditors.  
• Only once debts, bills, and taxes are cleared can the executor distribute the leftover assets according to the will’s instructions.

## Additional Resources and Guidance

• **Provincial Court Websites:** Provide forms, filing fees, and specific procedures. For example, [Ontario Court Forms](http://ontariocourtforms.on.ca/en/rules-of-civil-procedure-forms).  
• **Trust Companies:** RBC Royal Trust, BMO Trust, and TD Wealth Private Trust offer estate executor services and can handle complex situations.  
• **Self-Counsel Press “Probate Forms Kit”:** Offers standardized forms and step-by-step guides for multiple provinces.  
• **Regulatory Oversight:** The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization ([CIRO](https://www.ciro.ca)) is the national self-regulatory body for investment dealers and mutual fund dealers.  
• **CRA Publications:** Consult the Canada Revenue Agency’s guides on estate returns for tax filing requirements.
