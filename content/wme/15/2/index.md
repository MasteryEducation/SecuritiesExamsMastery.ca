## 15.2 Other Factors to Consider when Making a Will

When planning a client’s estate, a will is most effective if it anticipates and accounts for changing personal, financial, and regulatory circumstances. An outdated or incomplete will can result in unintended asset distribution, unforeseen legal hurdles, and potential burdens on one’s heirs. In this section, we explore several key factors for advisors and clients to address when making a will in Canada.

---

### Importance of Regular Updates

Clients’ lives can undergo significant transformations that warrant a will update. For example:  
- Marriage or entering into a common-law partnership  
- Birth or adoption of children  
- Separation, divorce, or remarriage  
- Acquiring real estate, a business, or other significant assets  
- Relocation to a different province or country  

From a wealth management perspective, ensuring the will remains aligned with current family and financial profiles is critical. Under the guidance of the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), advisors have a responsibility to encourage clients to keep their wills current. If a will fails to reflect changed circumstances, Canadian courts may distribute assets in a way the testator never intended.

---

### Contingency Beneficiaries and Alternate Executors

An essential provision in estate planning is designating alternate or backup individuals to fulfill pivotal roles should the primary choice be unavailable or unwilling to serve. Specifically:

1. **Contingency Beneficiaries**  
   - A client can name a “backup” beneficiary for assets that might otherwise revert to the estate.  
   - Example: If the testator’s spouse predeceases them, the estate can specify that certain assets pass directly to children, siblings, or other named parties.

2. **Alternate Executors**  
   - Executors manage and distribute the estate according to instructions in the will.  
   - If the primary executor is unable (or chooses not) to serve, an alternate executor steps in to minimize potential delays or legal disputes.

---

### Guardianship Provisions for Minor Children

Canadian laws typically allow parents to nominate a legal guardian for children under the age of majority through their wills. Clear guardianship instructions help avoid custody conflicts and can ensure that funds and other resources are managed responsibly on behalf of minors. For example:  
- Naming a sibling or close friend to care for children.  
- Establishing a testamentary trust to detail how and when funds will be distributed.  
- Including instructions regarding education costs, medical care, and day-to-day living expenses.

If no guardian is explicitly named, the courts typically decide guardianship based on the best interests of the child—an added layer of uncertainty during an already difficult time.

---

### Validity, Provincial Regulations, and Witnessing Requirements

Each Canadian province and territory has specific laws influencing how wills are created, witnessed, and validated. For instance, Ontario’s Succession Law Reform Act outlines rules for the minimum signing age, the necessary number of witnesses, and the validity of handwritten (holograph) wills. Other provincial frameworks share similar content but may differ on details. Key considerations include:

- **Minimum Age:** While the age of majority in most provinces is 18, some allow younger individuals to make a will under special circumstances (e.g., if already married).  
- **Witnessing Requirements:** Most provinces require two adults with no direct interest in the will to witness the testator’s signature.  
- **Holograph Wills:** Some jurisdictions recognize handwritten wills, but strict criteria (e.g., the need for the testator’s entire handwriting) must be met to ensure validity.  
- **Electronic or Digital Wills:** Certain provinces have begun recognizing e-wills, but guidance on authenticity and security can vary by region.  

Clients should always confirm local laws with a legal professional. Even a small and seemingly insignificant discrepancy—like a misunderstanding of witnessing requirements—can lead to costly probate disputes or invalidation of the entire will.

---

### Mental (Testamentary) Capacity

Under Canadian law, a testator must possess testamentary capacity, meaning they understand:  
- That they are creating a will.  
- The nature and approximate value of their assets.  
- The individuals (and possibly organizations) who can reasonably expect to benefit from their estate.  
- The implications of distributing their assets in the manner chosen.

Advisors have no authority to determine capacity but should encourage clients to obtain formal assessment if there are any concerns—particularly in complex family situations or if cognitive decline is suspected. A clear testamentary capacity reduces the risk of will challenges on the grounds of undue influence or lack of mental fitness.

---

### Letters of Wishes or Memoranda of Personal Property

Clients often have personal items (e.g., family heirlooms, jewelry, collectibles) with significant sentimental value. A will might not detail distribution for each item. Instead, advisors can suggest creating a separate “Letters of Wishes” or “Memoranda of Personal Property” document. While not always legally binding, these documents can:

- Provide clarity and reduce confusion among heirs.  
- Simplify the estate administration process.  
- Communicate personal hopes or sentiments with certain bequests.  

Because these letters usually do not have the same legal force as a will, they should not replace critical instructions that must appear in a properly executed will.

---

### Tax Implications and “Deemed Disposition”

In Canada, there is no traditional inheritance or estate tax at the federal level. Instead, the deceased is generally treated as if they have disposed of all their capital property at fair market value immediately before death (referred to as a “deemed disposition”). This may result in taxable capital gains if the assets have appreciated. Key points include:

1. **Registered Assets:**  
   - Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) assets are included in income on the deceased’s final tax return if not rolled over to a surviving spouse or financially dependent child.  
2. **Capital Gains on Securities:**  
   - Shares in a portfolio managed by a Canadian bank (e.g., RBC, TD, BMO) may trigger capital gains taxes on any increase in value since purchase.  
3. **Principal Residence Exemption:**  
   - Real property that qualifies as a “principal residence” is exempt from capital gains tax, though additional residences can be fully or partially taxable.  
4. **Planning Techniques:**  
   - Trusts, spousal rollovers, and estate freezes can defer or mitigate taxes.  
   - Estate planning that leverages charitable donations may provide tax credits.

Advisors are encouraged to work closely with tax professionals and refer to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) resources ([https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html)) to help clients forecast potential tax liabilities and manage tax-optimizing strategies.

### Practical Example: Updating a Will After Major Life Events

Consider a client who originally drafted a will soon after marriage, naming their spouse as primary beneficiary and their brother as alternate beneficiary. Over the years:  
1. The client has children.  
2. The couple finalizes a divorce.  
3. The client accumulates significant securities in both non-registered and registered accounts at RBC Dominion Securities.  

If the individual never updates the will:  
- The ex-spouse could inherit assets unexpectedly, depending on provincial laws around marital breakdown.  
- The children might not receive the care or oversight the client intended if guardianship instructions were never added.  
- Potential capital gains and RRSP distribution taxes could be triggered in suboptimal ways.

An updated will might:  
- Designate a new guardian for children.  
- Provide for a testamentary trust to fund education or living expenses.  
- Realign beneficiaries to reflect new family relationships.  
- Account for capital gains tax on the increased value of the RBC Dominion Securities portfolio.

### Potential Pitfalls

1. **Neglecting to Name an Alternate Executor**  
   Leads to court-appointed administration if the primary executor is unwilling or unable to serve.  
2. **Failing to Update Beneficiaries**  
   May result in ex-spouses or estranged relatives inheriting significant assets.  
3. **Overlooking Testamentary Trusts**  
   Without them, minors may receive large sums upon reaching the age of majority, lacking financial management guidelines.  
4. **Ignoring Tax Exposure**  
   Unnecessary taxes might erode the estate’s value, leaving heirs with less than intended.  
5. **Underestimating Family Dynamics**  
   Failing to address or acknowledge unique circumstances (e.g., blended families) can lead to disputes.
