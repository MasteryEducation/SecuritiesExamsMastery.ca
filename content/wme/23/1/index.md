## 23.1 The Role of Managed Products in Investment Management

Managed products are professionally overseen investment solutions designed to simplify and enhance portfolio construction for both retail and institutional investors. In Canada, these products are closely monitored by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) to ensure they meet stringent standards of disclosure, transparency, and investor protection.

Managed products often consolidate multiple underlying securities—such as stocks, bonds, and alternative assets—into a single package with a defined investment goal or strategy. These structures range from the familiar (e.g., mutual funds, exchange-traded funds) to more specialized solutions (e.g., hedge funds and overlay management programs). This section explores the essentials of managed products, including why they are used, how they fit into the Canadian regulatory environment, and the key factors to consider when recommending them.

### Why Managed Products Matter

1. **Diversification and Risk Management**  
   • Managed products commonly spread holdings across diverse asset classes and industries. This diversification helps mitigate losses and stabilize returns, especially during periods of market volatility.  
   • For example, a balanced mutual fund might invest in Canadian equities (like those listed on the TSX), government bonds, and even global securities, thereby reducing the risk concentration in a single sector or region.

2. **Professional Management**  
   • Portfolio managers behind managed products bring specialized expertise—like analyzing financial statements, building tax-efficient strategies, or using sophisticated quantitative models.  
   • Many large Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), use institutional-level management strategies professionally honed to optimize risk-adjusted returns. Retail investors can gain access to some of these strategies through certain managed products.

3. **Economies of Scale**  
   • When large sums of money are pooled, the fees per investor are often lower than if each investor attempted the same strategies individually.  
   • This advantage allows cost-effective participation in complex or specialized opportunities, such as emerging markets or sector-specific mandates.

4. **Convenience and Accessibility**  
   • Daily purchasing or redemption options for many managed products make them straightforward to incorporate into a portfolio.  
   • Investors without the time or inclination to manage individual stocks or bonds find managed solutions beneficial for automating rebalancing, reinvesting dividends, and handling compliance requirements.

5. **Alignment with Investment Objectives**  
   • Different managed products cater to various goals—some focus on growth, others on stable income, and others on capital preservation.  
   • Canadian banks (e.g., RBC, TD, BMO) offer a variety of actively managed and passive funds designed to match specific risk profiles and investment philosophies.

### Types of Managed Products

Managed products can take many forms, each with distinct advantages and structural considerations:

1. **Mutual Funds**  
   • Regulated significantly by National Instrument 81-102.  
   • Often actively managed, striving to outperform a benchmark.  
   • Provide diversification, professional oversight, and daily liquidity.

2. **Wrap Products**  
   • Combine multiple investment strategies or funds under one “wrap” or umbrella program.  
   • Typically feature a single fee covering asset allocation, selection, and ongoing monitoring.

3. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**  
   • Traded on exchanges like the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).  
   • Usually track a specific index or sector, providing broad exposure at relatively low cost.  
   • Offer intraday trading and potentially lower management fees than many actively managed funds.

4. **Hedge Funds**  
   • Employ advanced strategies, including leverage, short selling, and derivatives.  
   • Offer opportunities for enhanced returns but carry higher risk, fees, and often stricter eligibility requirements.  
   • In Canada, hedge funds are subject to regulatory oversight and may require accredited investor status.

5. **Overlay Management**  
   • Focuses on managing the total portfolio’s risk exposure by using derivatives or other instruments across multiple underlying strategies.  
   • Commonly used by pension funds to fine-tune currency hedging or sector allocations in a cost-efficient manner.

6. **Outcome-Based Investments**  
   • Often target a specific outcome, such as capital preservation with a guaranteed minimum return or a particular income stream.  
   • Examples include structured notes or Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) contracts, each requiring thorough due diligence to understand fees and liquidity constraints.

### Regulatory Landscape in Canada

Canada’s regulatory environment ensures transparency and investor protection:

- **Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)**  
  • An umbrella organization of provincial and territorial regulators.  
  • Oversees the development and enforcement of National Instruments like NI 81-102 for mutual funds and NI 81-107 on independent review committees.  
  • Coordinates policy to maintain efficient capital markets.

- **Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO)**  
  • As of January 1, 2023, the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) merged into CIRO (effective June 1, 2023).  
  • CIRO supervises investment dealers and mutual fund dealers across Canada, setting proficiency, registration, and conduct standards.  
  • Advises how dealers should recommend and monitor managed products based on client suitability and risk profiles.

- **Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF)**  
  • Became the sole protection fund for all investment dealers and mutual fund dealers under CIRO.  
  • Provides coverage if a CIRO dealer becomes insolvent, safeguarding client assets up to defined limits.

### Key Considerations for Advisors

1. **Risk Tolerance**  
   • Understanding how much volatility a client can handle helps determine the appropriate managed solution.  
   • For instance, an investor with low risk tolerance may prefer a balanced fund with a lower equity fraction.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**  
   • Specific goals (e.g., saving for retirement in 20 years vs. building a down payment in 5 years) will guide product selection.  
   • Advisors must select products that match the client’s timeline for liquidity, growth, and distributions.

3. **Costs and Educational Transparency**  
   • Expense ratios, trading commissions, and embedded fees all affect returns; advisors must disclose these clearly.  
   • Understanding Management Expense Ratios (MERs) and trailing commissions helps clients make informed choices.

4. **Product Liquidity**  
   • Some managed products (like certain hedge funds) restrict redemptions to monthly or quarterly windows.  
   • Advisors must align product liquidity with clients’ short-term needs to avoid cash flow mismatches.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   • Advisors have the obligation to ensure products match the client’s “Know Your Client” (KYC) profile.  
   • Ensuring ongoing suitability requires periodic reviews and rebalancing when client circumstances or regulations change.

6. **Market and Strategy Shifts**  
   • Managed products evolve over time (new fees, strategy changes, manager turnover).  
   • Advisors should track such shifts to confirm the product still aligns with client objectives.

### Practical Case Study: Canadian Banks’ Diversified Funds

Consider an investor at a major Canadian bank (e.g., RBC). The institution offers a range of mutual funds under its brand:

1. **RBC Balanced Fund**  
   • Typically invests in a mix of Canadian and global equities along with fixed income.  
   • May shift allocations based on macroeconomic outlook, aiming to reduce volatility while providing steady returns.

2. **RBC Dividend Fund**  
   • Focuses on dividend-paying Canadian equities.  
   • Favors investors who seek regular income and moderate growth.

By opting for these mutual funds, the investor outsources security selection and rebalancing to RBC's professional managers and benefits from diversification. Fees, such as the MER, are disclosed in the fund’s prospectus, and RBC’s advisors must verify suitability regularly.

```

- **Explanation:**  
  1. The client invests capital into a managed product (e.g., mutual fund, ETF).  
  2. A professional manager handles asset allocation, security selection, and periodic rebalancing.  
  3. The manager aims to deliver returns consistent with the fund’s stated objectives, whether that is growth, income, or a specific outcome (e.g., capital preservation).

### Best Practices, Pitfalls, and Strategies

- **Best Practice:** Conduct a comprehensive “Know Your Client” review. Align products to specific life goals (e.g., retirement, education savings) and risk levels.  
- **Pitfall:** Focusing too narrowly on short-term performance might cause chasing “hot” funds. Encourage a long-term perspective instead.  
- **Strategy to Solve Pitfall:** Establish a disciplined review schedule—e.g., semi-annually—where performance, market outlook, and product costs are reviewed and rebalanced as needed.
