## 14.4 Assessing Preferred Share Investment Quality

Preferred shares occupy a middle ground between equities and fixed-income securities. They combine the potential upside of equity participation (especially in the case of convertible preferreds) with more stable and predictable income streams that resemble interest payments on bonds. Since they typically carry fixed or floating dividends and stand ahead of common shares in the corporate capital structure, many Canadian investors see them as strategic vehicles for balance and tax-efficiency. This section will explore the critical factors you should evaluate when assessing the investment quality of preferred shares within a Canadian context.

## Understanding the Nature and Features of Preferred Shares

### What Are Preferred Shares?
Preferred shares (often referred to simply as “preferreds”) are a distinct class of corporate ownership that offers investors priority claim over common shareholders in two critical areas:  
• Dividend payments (they generally receive dividends before common shareholders).  
• Distribution of assets in the event of corporate liquidation (though still below bondholders).

Because of their unique position in the capital structure, preferred shares often trade with yield characteristics similar to bonds, while maintaining some equity-like features, particularly if they are convertible into common shares or if their payouts can fluctuate.

### Key Features of Preferred Shares
Below are some essential features that define preferred shares:

• Dividend Priority: Preferred shareholders are paid dividends before any dividends are paid to common shareholders.  
• Fixed or Floating Dividend: Some preferred shares pay a fixed dividend yield (e.g., 5%), while others pay a floating rate tied to a benchmark such as the Government of Canada Treasury bill rate or prime rate.  
• Perpetual vs. Term: Perpetual preferreds have no maturity date, whereas term-based preferreds may be retractable (redeemable by the shareholder) or callable (redeemable by the issuer).  
• Ranking in Capital Structure: Preferreds are junior to corporate bonds but senior to common stock.

## Types of Preferred Shares

Many types of preferred shares exist in Canada, each with distinct risk and reward profiles. Understanding the nuances is crucial for matching the right preferred shares to an investor’s strategy and risk tolerance.

### Cumulative vs. Non-Cumulative Preferreds
• Cumulative: If dividends are missed or cut due to the issuer’s financial difficulties, the skipped dividends accrue and must be paid in full before common shareholders can receive dividends again. This structure provides a degree of protection to preferred shareholders, as it guarantees the eventual payment of missed dividends (subject to the issuer’s viability).  
• Non-Cumulative: If the issuer suspends or skips a dividend, non-cumulative preferred shareholders have no claim to missed payments. Thus, these are riskier from a dividend stability perspective.

### Convertible vs. Non-Convertible Preferreds
• Convertible: These can be converted into a specified number of common shares at certain dates or under certain conditions. Convertibility can provide substantial upside if the underlying common stock appreciates significantly. However, the conversion terms must be carefully examined, including conversion ratios and exchange conditions.  
• Non-Convertible: Provide no opportunity to convert into common shares, thus offering fewer avenues for capital appreciation. Their main appeal lies in stable dividend income and a generally more predictable risk profile.

### Retractable, Callable, and Perpetual Preferreds
• Retractable Preferreds: Give shareholders the right to “put” (sell) the shares back to the issuer at predetermined times and prices. This feature may protect the investor if interest rates rise or the share price declines.  
• Callable Preferreds: Grant the issuer the right to buy back (or “call”) the shares before maturity, often at a premium to par value. Issuers typically exercise this right when interest rates fall, allowing them to refinance at lower costs.  
• Perpetual Preferreds: Have no maturity date. Investors must gauge whether the dividend yield compensates for potentially indefinite interest rate risk.

## Evaluating Creditworthiness and Default Risk

### Issuer’s Overall Creditworthiness
While preferred shares stand ahead of common equity in the capital structure, they remain subordinate to debt obligations such as bonds. Thus, an issuer’s overall credit rating is one of the most critical metrics in determining the default risk. Canadian banks, such as RBC or TD, typically have high credit ratings, reflecting more stable dividend streams. Meanwhile, a smaller, more volatile corporation might carry a lower rating, implying higher default risk and potentially higher yields.

#### Key Sources of Credit Ratings  
Agencies including DBRS Morningstar, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings assess the creditworthiness of Canadian companies, providing letter-grade ratings. Some institutional and retail investors have guidelines or regulations requiring minimum credit ratings for portfolio purchases. Always refer to official sources like SEDAR filings, bond rating agency websites, and issuer annual reports for validation and updated data.

---

## Dividend Coverage and Financial Strength

### Dividend Coverage Ratio
The reliability of preferred dividends often hinges on the issuer’s cash flow. One common measure is the dividend coverage ratio, which can be simplified as:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Dividend Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Dividends on Preferred and Common Shares}}
{{< /katex >}}

Some analysts focus primarily on preferred share dividends to get a more conservative view:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Preferred Dividend Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Income } - \text{ Common Dividends (if any priority is recognized)}}{\text{Preferred Dividends}}
{{< /katex >}}

A strong coverage ratio suggests the issuer has sufficient income to consistently meet its dividend obligations on preferred shares. However, always read the issuer’s financial statements in detail—particularly the statement of cash flows—to confirm whether earnings translate into actual cash.

### Free Cash Flow Analysis
Many confine themselves to net earnings but ignore cash flows. An issuer might appear profitable, but if cash flow is constrained (due to high capital expenditures, for instance), maintaining dividend payments can become challenging. Look into:  
• Operational cash flow vs. total dividends.  
• Capital expenditures (CapEx) and debt service obligations.  
• Trends in free cash flow over multiple quarters or years.

## Tax Considerations for Canadian Investors

### Dividend Tax Credit
In Canada, dividends from eligible Canadian corporations often qualify for the dividend tax credit, reducing an investor’s effective tax rate compared to interest income. Investors in higher tax brackets may benefit substantially from this credit. Consult the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website (https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html) for details on how the dividend tax credit applies in your province.

### RRSP, TFSA, and Other Tax-Sheltered Accounts
Preferred share dividends within Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) or Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) can reduce or eliminate immediate tax liability, allowing the dividend income to compound. For instance, if you hold preferred shares of a major Canadian bank inside your TFSA, dividend income and capital gains are free from tax, potentially improving net returns.

### Provincial Variations
Each province may have different surtaxes or dividend tax credits. For example, Ontario and Quebec have distinct rates. Ensure that you verify how your province’s tax structure affects the net yield.

---

## Yield and Risk Trade-Offs

### Comparing Preferred Yields to Bonds
Preferred shares typically offer higher yields than the same issuer’s bonds. This occurs because, despite the dividend priority over common shares, preferred shareholders still rank behind bondholders in a default scenario.

### Price Volatility and Liquidity
Preferred share prices can be more volatile than bonds because of:  
• Reduced trading liquidity.  
• Greater susceptibility to equity market sentiment.  
• Dividend cancellations if the issuer faces financial distress (especially for non-cumulative preferreds).  

Still, preferred shareholders may experience fewer price fluctuations than common shareholders due to more stable dividend income.

---

## Interest Rate Sensitivity

### Fixed-Rate Preferred Shares
Fixed-rate perpetual preferreds can exhibit significant interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, the market price of these shares often falls because their fixed dividends become less attractive relative to prevailing yields.

### Rate-Reset Preferred Shares
Many Canadian issuers offer rate-reset preferred shares, where the dividend is periodically reset based on a benchmark (such as the 5-year Government of Canada bond yield) plus a stated spread. This mechanism reduces interest rate risk relative to strictly perpetual fixed-rate preferreds, though the spread and reset date remain crucial details.

### Floating-Rate Preferred Shares
Dividend rates may float with short-term benchmarks. These shares can have lower price volatility in a rising interest rate environment. However, in a declining rate environment, floating-rate dividends decrease, which might reduce the share’s appeal.

## Practical Example: Evaluating a Hypothetical Preferred Share from a Canadian Bank

Suppose RBC (a fictional example for illustration) issues a perpetual non-cumulative preferred share with a 5% annual dividend. You want to evaluate whether this is suitable for your portfolio. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Check RBC’s creditworthiness: RBC is historically well-rated by DBRS Morningstar, S&P, and Fitch. This high rating indicates relatively low default risk.  
2. Review financial statements and coverage ratios: Assess RBC’s recent financial statements, ensuring that net income and free cash flow sufficiently exceed total preferred dividends.  
3. Understand the share’s features: Being perpetual means no maturity date. The dividend is non-cumulative, so if RBC were ever to skip a payment, you would not receive it later.  
4. Assess tax implications: If you hold this share in a TFSA, the dividend would be tax-free. Otherwise, you’d likely qualify for the dividend tax credit to reduce taxes owed.  
5. Compare yield: The 5% yield might be higher than the yield on RBC bonds, but it comes with subordination risk because bondholders rank higher in a liquidation event.  
6. Rate environment: If interest rates rise, a fixed-rate perpetual’s price may drop, impacting potential capital gains or resale value.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• Best Practices:  
  1. Regularly Monitor Credit Trends: Issue downgrades often precede dividend cuts.  
  2. Diversify Across Sectors and Types: Avoid overconcentration in one sector or type of preferred share.  
  3. Reassess Market Conditions: Rising or falling interest rates can significantly alter the attractiveness of preferred share yields.  
  4. Leverage Regulatory Filings: CIRO and CSA guidelines on capital adequacy can indicate an issuer’s financial strength.

• Common Pitfalls:  
  1. Ignoring Call Features: If the preferred share is callable, you risk reinvestment at potentially lower rates when the issuer redeems it.  
  2. Overlooking Non-Cumulative Risk: Missing a dividend on a non-cumulative share could permanently reduce your income.  
  3. Misinterpreting Liquidity Risk: Some preferred shares trade with low daily volumes, which can lead to wider bid-ask spreads.  
  4. Failing to Consider Tax Treatments: Investors may unintentionally reduce their after-tax return if they don’t factor in the dividend tax credit properly.

> **Explanation:** Preferred shares usually pay dividends before common shares and rank above common equity in a liquidation scenario. However, they do not rank above bonds. Some preferred shares are perpetual, while others may be callable, retractable, or convertible.

### Which type of preferred share guarantees that missed dividends will accrue and must be paid before dividends on common shares?

- [x] Cumulative preferred shares  
- [ ] Non-cumulative preferred shares  
- [ ] Callable preferred shares  
- [ ] Perpetual preferred shares  

> **Explanation:** Cumulative preferred shares ensure payment of skipped dividends in the future. In contrast, non-cumulative shares do not make up for missed dividends.

- [ ] The issuer’s market share in its industry  
- [ ] The growth of the issuer’s capital expenditures only  
- [ ] The issuer’s marketing expenses  

> **Explanation:** Investors focus on whether the issuer produces sufficient income and/or cash flow to cover the preferred dividend obligation. The most direct measure is net income (or free cash flow) divided by total preferred dividends.

### Which statement about the dividend tax credit in Canada is correct?

- [x] It can significantly reduce the tax payable on dividends from eligible Canadian corporations.  
- [ ] It is not available to Canadian residents.  
- [ ] It applies only to dividends received from foreign corporations.  
- [ ] It is the same in every province.  

> **Explanation:** The dividend tax credit is available to Canadian residents who receive dividends from eligible Canadian corporations. Tax treatment may vary by province.

### What is a key difference between a callable and a retractable preferred share?

- [x] A callable share gives the issuer the right to redeem; a retractable share gives investors the right to redeem.  
- [ ] A callable share is convertible, while a retractable share is not convertible.  
- [ ] A retractable share is always perpetual, whereas a callable share has a fixed term.  
- [ ] Callable shares and retractable shares are identical.  

> **Explanation:** Callable preferred shares can be redeemed at the issuer’s discretion, often at a predetermined price. Retractable shares can be sold back to the issuer by the investor at specific times or conditions.

### Why do fixed-rate perpetual preferred shares tend to exhibit more price volatility when interest rates change?

- [x] Their fixed dividend becomes more or less attractive relative to changing market rates.  
- [ ] They are required to increase dividends when interest rates rise.  
- [ ] They automatically convert to common shares in a low-interest environment.  
- [ ] They carry no interest rate risk whatsoever.  

> **Explanation:** When interest rates rise, the fixed dividend paid by perpetual preferred shares becomes relatively unattractive, often causing the share price to drop to align the yield with the new market rates.

### Which factor does NOT directly affect the tax efficiency of preferred shares?

- [x] The issuer’s profit margin relative to its peers  
- [ ] Holding preferred shares in a registered account  
- [ ] Qualifying for the dividend tax credit  
- [ ] Provincial tax differences  

> **Explanation:** While the issuer’s profit margin can influence the sustainability of dividends, it is not a direct factor in the tax treatment or tax perks that a shareholder receives.

### A Canadian investor is evaluating preferred shares from a corporation that has recently been downgraded by a major rating agency. Which risk is most directly highlighted by this downgrade?

- [x] Default or dividend suspension risk  
- [ ] Currency exchange rate volatility  
- [ ] Global interest rate fluctuations  
- [ ] The risk of corporate share buybacks  

> **Explanation:** A downgrade often indicates that the agency views the issuer’s financial health less favorably, increasing the potential risk of dividend cuts or default.

### If a preferred share has a dividend rate that resets every five years based on a Canadian bond yield plus a fixed spread, which category does it belong to?

- [x] Rate-reset preferred shares  
- [ ] Non-cumulative preferred shares  
- [ ] Convertible preferred shares  
- [ ] Floating-rate preferred shares  

> **Explanation:** A rate-reset preferred share adjusts its dividend payout periodically (commonly every five years) in relation to a benchmark yield, typically a Government of Canada bond rate.

### Preferred shares rank ahead of common shares in the capital structure regarding dividends and liquidation.

- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> **Explanation:** Preferred shares do have priority over common shares for dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation. This does not guarantee zero risk but offers more protection compared to common stock.
