## 13.4 Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is the practice of studying historical price and volume data to anticipate future trends in the securities markets. It assumes that the market discounts all accessible information, that prices move in discernable patterns, and that these patterns repeat over time. Canadian investors often use technical analysis strategies—alone or in conjunction with fundamental analysis—to strengthen their trading decisions and manage risk within the regulatory framework overseen by Canadian self-regulatory organizations such as CIRO (Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization).

This section presents an in-depth exploration of technical analysis, including foundational assumptions, chart types, key patterns, technical indicators, and the advantages and limitations of these strategies within the Canadian markets.

### Defining Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is built on the premise that price and volume data reflect investor sentiment, market psychology, and supply-demand dynamics. Since prices adjust rapidly to reflect new information, many technical analysts believe it is more effective to focus on market patterns than to rely solely on macroeconomic factors, corporate financial statements, or market fundamentals.

Key reasons to employ technical analysis include:
• Identifying market trends early.  
• Spotting price reversal signals.  
• Pinpointing entry and exit points.  
• Augmenting or confirming fundamental analysis.

---

### Key Assumptions of Technical Analysis

There are three core assumptions central to technical analysis:

1. **Market Discounts Everything**  
   Technical analysts assume that all publicly available information—corporate earnings, economic news, and broader market sentiments—is already reflected in the asset’s price.

2. **Prices Move in Trends**  
   Once a trend is established—bullish (upward), bearish (downward), or sideways—it will persist until evidence suggests otherwise. Investors often focus on trend identification and continuation signals.

3. **History Tends to Repeat Itself**  
   Market psychology and investor behavior recur in patterns that, once identified, can be used to anticipate future price trajectories. Chart patterns like head and shoulders or double tops are considered manifestations of repeated investor psychology over time.

### Charts and Patterns

Charts provide a visual representation of price and volume data. Understanding their construction helps technical analysts identify key levels and evaluate future price movements.

#### Types of Charts

• **Line Chart:** Depicts price changes over time using a single continuous line (often closing prices). It offers a simple overview but omits intraday volatility.  

• **Bar Chart:** Shows the open, high, low, and close (OHLC) for each time frame (e.g., daily, weekly). Analysts often prefer bar charts for their detailed view of price action.  

• **Candlestick Chart:** Similar to a bar chart, but uses “candles” with bodies representing the difference between the open and close and wicks representing highs and lows. Candlestick patterns (e.g., doji, hammer) can provide signals about market turning points.  

• **Point-and-Figure Chart:** Focuses solely on price changes (not time). Price moves are represented by column Xs (rising prices) and Os (falling prices). Point-and-figure charts help eliminate minor price fluctuations, emphasizing major price reversals.

#### Support and Resistance

• **Support Level:** A price threshold below which a stock or index has historically not fallen. Buyers often step in here, creating a “floor.”  
• **Resistance Level:** The level at which selling pressure is strong enough to halt a price rise. It acts as a “ceiling.”

When a price breaks through a strong support or resistance, it may signal a change in sentiment. For example, surpassing resistance with high volume could indicate a bullish breakout.

#### Trend Lines

Trend lines connect successive higher lows in an uptrend or lower highs in a downtrend. They help illustrate the market’s directional bias. An uptrend line is drawn by connecting at least two low points, while a downtrend line links at least two high points. A breached trend line, confirmed by higher or lower closes, can be an early warning signal of trend reversal.

Below is a simple Mermaid.js diagram to visualize how trend lines are formed:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A((Higher Low)) --> B((Next Higher Low))
    B --> C((Next Higher Low))
    style A fill:#bfdfff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    style B fill:#bfdfff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    style C fill:#bfdfff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;

    subgraph Prices
    A ---> B ---> C
    end
```

#### Chart Patterns

Chart patterns typically fall into two broad categories: continuation and reversal.  

1. **Continuation Patterns**  
   • **Triangles:** Price converges into a triangle, and a breakout typically continues in the direction of the prevailing trend.  
   • **Flags and Pennants:** Short consolidation periods within a strong trend, after which price often resumes its previous direction.  

2. **Reversal Patterns**  
   • **Head and Shoulders:** Consists of three peaks, with the middle peak (the head) higher than the others. Breaking the neckline confirms a possible reversal.  
   • **Double Top/Bottom:** Occur when price tests the same level twice and fails to move beyond it. The pattern suggests a potential reversal.

---

### Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are quantitative tools that complement chart pattern analysis. They help measure momentum, volatility, and sentiment.

#### Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth out price fluctuations, making it easier to identify trends and confirm support/resistance levels.  

• **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Averages the closing prices for a fixed number of periods (e.g., 20-day SMA).  
• **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to sudden price changes.

One common strategy is to watch for a “golden cross,” where a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, signaling potential bullish momentum.

#### Momentum Oscillators

Oscillators gauge the speed and magnitude of price changes, often helping traders identify overbought or oversold conditions.

• **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** A scale from 0 to 100; readings above 70 suggest overbought conditions, while readings below 30 suggest oversold conditions.  
• **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** Tracks the difference between two EMAs and includes a signal line. Crossovers above or below the signal line can trigger buy or sell signals.

#### Volume Analysis

Volume can validate the significance of price moves. For instance, an upward price breakout accompanied by a surge in volume suggests robust buying interest. Conversely, a breakout on low volume may be a “false” or weak signal.

---

### Limitations and Criticisms

While technical analysis is widely adopted, it does face criticisms:

1. **Subjectivity:** Drawing trend lines, identifying patterns, and interpreting signals can vary among analysts.  
2. **Whipsaws:** Sudden market reversals can produce false or conflicting signals, especially in volatile or “choppy” markets.  
3. **Market Efficiency Debate:** If markets exhibit strong-form efficiency, any recurring pattern could be arbitraged away once discovered. Critics argue that technical patterns may stop working when widely followed.

Traders using technical analysis should remain adaptable, employing risk management techniques like stop-loss orders to limit losses in the event of whipsaws.

---

### Combining Technical with Fundamental Analysis

Technical analysis can add value when integrated with fundamental approaches:

• **Strategic Blends:** A value investor identifying an undervalued stock may wait for a bullish technical signal—like a breakout above resistance on strong volume—before buying.  
• **Risk Management:** Setting close technical stop-loss levels can hedge downside risk for portfolios primarily driven by fundamental investment theses.

For example, Canadian pension funds with a long-term fundamental outlook might still utilize technical triggers for tactical rebalancing or short-term trading decisions, especially during volatile markets.

---

### Glossary

• **Support Level:** A price level at which a stock or market tends to find buying interest as it declines.  
• **Resistance Level:** A price level at which a stock or market repeatedly encounters selling pressure.  
• **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** A momentum-based indicator derived from moving averages.  
• **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** An oscillator ranging from 0 to 100, used to identify overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) market conditions.

---

### Practical Canadian Examples and Real-World Scenarios

To illustrate practical uses of technical analysis in the Canadian market:

1. **Canadian Bank Stocks (e.g., RBC, TD):** Traders might use RSI to identify short-term oversold conditions when economic headlines turn negative. If RSI dips below 30 while fundamentals remain robust, investors could see a potential entry point.  
2. **Canadian Pension Funds:** Institutions like the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan often take a longer-term view but may employ technical signals for timing certain trades or tactical allocations.  
3. **TSX Composite Breakouts:** Watching the S&P/TSX Composite Index for breakouts above historical resistance levels can help gauge overall market sentiment and confirm sector-wide strength.
