## 7.1 Calculating Price and Yield of a Bond

Bond pricing and yield calculations are essential components of fixed-income analysis in Canada and abroad. Understanding these concepts helps you effectively assess the risks, returns, and suitability of bond investments. This section covers key elements of bond valuation, including price and yield relationships, calculation methods, clean versus dirty pricing, and special yield measures such as Yield to Call (YTC). We will use Canadian examples and note relevant regulations from organizations like the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and the Bank of Canada.

## Overview: Price-Yield Relationship

At the heart of bond valuation lies the inverse relationship between bond prices and market interest rates (yields):  
• When market interest rates rise, existing bonds with lower coupon rates become less attractive, decreasing their market price.  
• When market interest rates fall, existing bonds with higher coupon rates become more attractive, increasing their market price.

Bondholders and potential investors should be aware of this relationship because changes in prevailing interest rates directly influence bond prices and yields. This inverted price-yield dynamic transcends all types of bonds, from Government of Canada bonds to corporate bonds issued by major financial institutions like RBC or TD Bank.

## Key Concepts in Bond Pricing

### Par Value (Face Value)
The par value (or face value) is the amount the issuer promises to pay at maturity. In the Canadian market, par value is often $1,000, though it can vary.

### Coupon Rate
The bond’s coupon rate specifies the annual interest paid on the face value. A 5% coupon on a $1,000 bond, for example, pays $50 in interest per year (often in semi-annual installments of $25 each).

### Discounting
Discounting is the process of determining the present value of future cash flows. Each coupon payment and the repayment of par value at maturity are discounted back to the present using the appropriate market yield (or required rate of return).

### Clean Price vs. Dirty Price
In Canadian fixed-income markets, bond prices are typically quoted on a clean price basis, which excludes accrued interest. However, when settling a trade, the buyer must pay the dirty price, which is:
  
Dirty Price = Clean Price + Accrued Interest  

Accrued interest is the interest earned since the last coupon date but not yet paid; it compensates the seller for the coupon portion that has built up during the holding period.

## Calculating Bond Price

The standard formula for the price (P) of a coupon-paying bond is the sum of the present value (PV) of all future coupon payments plus the present value of the bond’s par value at maturity:

{{< katex >}}
P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + R)^t} + \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1 + R)^n}
{{< /katex >}}

Where:  
• \\( C \\) = Coupon payment per period (annual coupon divided by the number of coupon payments per year).  
• \\( n \\) = Total number of coupon periods.  
• \\( R \\) = Yield per coupon period (the required market yield divided by the number of coupon payments per year).  

If coupons are paid semi-annually, the coupon payment is halved, and the yield is also expressed on a semi-annual basis.

### Example: Pricing a Corporate Bond from RBC
Consider a fictitious RBC 5-year bond with a 4% annual coupon (2% paid semi-annually), par value of $1,000, and a required yield (market yield) of 5% per year (2.5% per semi-annual period).

Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Semi-annual coupon payment (C) = 4% of $1,000 / 2 = $20.  
2. Yield per coupon period (R) = 5% / 2 = 2.5%.  
3. Total number of coupon payments (n) = 5 years × 2 payments/year = 10.  
4. Present Value of coupons:
   {{< katex >}}
   \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{20}{(1 + 0.025)^t}
   {{< /katex >}}
5. Present Value of par value at maturity:
   {{< katex >}}
   \frac{1{,}000}{(1 + 0.025)^{10}}
   {{< /katex >}}
6. Add these present values to get the total bond price.

You can use a financial calculator, spreadsheet, or open-source Python library like QuantLib to perform these steps quickly.

## Yield to Maturity (YTM)

Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the annualized rate of return an investor can expect if they purchase the bond at the current market price and hold it until maturity, assuming all coupons are reinvested at the same yield. Because it incorporates all future coupon payments and the redemption of par value, YTM is widely referenced as a comprehensive measure of return.

### Example: Yield to Maturity Computation
Suppose you can purchase a TD Bank bond with a 3.5% coupon, five years remaining until maturity, priced at $970. The problem is to find the YTM. Here’s a simplified conceptual approach:

1. Use a trial-and-error method or a financial calculator function such as IRR/YTM.  
2. Input the bond’s current price as the present value (PV = –$970), coupon flows of $35 per year (3.5% of $1,000), plus $1,000 redemption at maturity.  
3. Solve for the annual yield (i.e., the discount rate) that sets the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows to zero.

This yields the annual YTM. Bonds quoted in the Canadian market usually reference a semi-annual yield, so the calculator would typically split the annual coupon into two equal payments and solve for the semi-annual discount rate, then annualize it.

## Alternative Yield Measures

### Current Yield
Current Yield = Annual Coupon / Current Market Price

While quick to compute, current yield does not account for the time value of money or the maturity value. It only measures the annual coupon relative to the bond’s current market price.

### Yield to Call (YTC)
For callable bonds, the Yield to Call (YTC) calculation assumes that the issuer will call the bond at the first available call date (and at the stated call price). This can significantly alter the bond’s expected cash flows.

### Yield to Put (YTP)
Less common in the Canadian market but still relevant is Yield to Put, which applies when the bond has a put feature allowing the holder to demand early redemption.

## Clean Price vs. Dirty Price in Context

### Accrued Interest
In the Canadian market, bond prices on statements and quotes exclude accrued interest. However, the prudent investor must remember that the total settlement amount (the dirty price) will be adjusted upward or downward due to accrued interest.

Let’s visualize the concept:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Clean Price] --> B[+ Accrued Interest] --> C(Dirty Price)
```

• Clean Price: Quoted price seen in the market or on trading platforms.  
• Accrued Interest: Compensation to the bond seller for holding the bond and accruing its coupon between payment dates.  
• Dirty Price: Actual amount the buyer pays upon settlement.

## Practical Tools and Techniques

### Financial Calculators
Specialized financial calculators can handle time value of money (TVM) functions, allowing quick computation of bond price or YTM with just a few inputs:  
• N: number of periods to maturity  
• I/Y: yield or discount rate per period  
• PMT: coupon payment per period  
• FV: face (par) value  
• PV: present value (bond’s price)

### Spreadsheet Software
Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc offer built-in functions such as:  
• =PRICE()  
• =YIELD()  

These formulas automate discounting calculations. Always keep your compounding frequency aligned with the bond’s coupon frequency.

### Open-Source Libraries
QuantLib (https://www.quantlib.org/) is a widely used open-source C++ library for quantitative finance. It supports Python bindings as well, making it a popular option among analysts for complex bond analytics.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

1. Neglecting Semi-Annual Payments  
   Canadian bonds often pay coupons semi-annually. Ensure formulas and financial calculator settings match the correct frequency.

2. Ignoring Accrued Interest  
   Failing to account for accrued interest leads to underestimating the actual cost of purchasing a bond.

3. Overlooking Callable/Put Features  
   Bonds with embedded options may significantly alter potential returns, making YTC or YTP more relevant than YTM.

4. Incorrectly Handling Yields in Calculations  
   Always convert annual yields to the proper periodic yields (semi-annual, quarterly, etc.) before discounting.

5. Reinvestment Assumption for YTM  
   YTM assumes coupon reinvestment at the same yield, which may not be realistic if interest rates change.

6. Monitoring Market Shifts and Economic Indicators  
   Keep an eye on Bank of Canada announcements, which can affect interest rates and, therefore, bond yields.

## Real-World Case Study: Canadian Pension Fund

A Canadian pension fund investing in long-term Government of Canada bonds must carefully manage bond portfolios to align with liabilities. By calculating YTM for various maturities and coupons, the pension fund ensures sufficient cash flow to meet future obligations. The fund might reinvest coupons in shorter-term instruments or additional bonds, aiming to maintain a stable and predictable income stream over decades.

## Summary

Bond pricing and yield calculations form the cornerstone of fixed-income analysis. By applying time value of money principles, accounting for coupon frequencies, and being mindful of Canadian market conventions, investors can accurately evaluate the attractiveness of a bond. YTM captures the overall return if the bond is held to maturity, while current yield and YTC cater to different investment needs and considerations. Whether you are a retail investor or a buy-side manager overseeing billions of dollars in securities, mastering these valuation fundamentals is critical to prudent decision-making in the Canadian fixed-income marketplace.
