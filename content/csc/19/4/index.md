## 19.4 The Risks of Investing in Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have grown significantly in popularity among Canadian investors. They offer diversification, convenience, and often lower fees than many mutual funds. However, despite these advantages, ETFs still carry inherent risks. In this section, we explore the major categories of risks associated with ETF investments, illustrate them with real-world Canadian examples, and discuss regulatory considerations specific to the Canadian market. By understanding these risks, investors can make more informed decisions and align ETF investments with their broader financial goals.

## Market Risk

As with any security, ETFs are subject to market risk. When overall market sentiment deteriorates—due to macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, or unexpected events—ETF values can decline.

1. If you hold an ETF that tracks the S&P/TSX Composite Index, the fund will likely fall in value if the broader Canadian equity market faces a downturn.  
2. Similarly, bond ETFs can also experience price fluctuations when interest rates change, reflecting the broader turmoil in fixed-income markets.

### Example: Canadian Equity Market Downturn  
• If a Canadian pension fund invests in an ETF tracking the S&P/TSX Composite and the Canadian market experiences a significant correction, the ETF’s value will also drop proportionally.  

### Best Practices to Manage Market Risk  
• Diversify across different asset classes (equities, fixed-income, commodities, etc.).  
• Reassess your long-term investment strategy to ensure you have a suitable asset allocation for your risk tolerance.  
• Utilize stop-loss orders or hedging strategies, where suitable, although be mindful of transaction costs.

## Tracking Error

“Tracking error” refers to the difference between the ETF’s actual returns and the benchmark index it intends to replicate. While most ETFs strive to minimize this gap, several factors can cause discrepancies:

• Management Fees: Even if the ETF is passively managed, fees slightly reduce returns.  
• Sampling Methods: Some ETFs hold a representative sample of securities rather than the entire index, which can lead to performance deviations.  
• Illiquidity of Underlying Securities: Thinly traded or hard-to-obtain components of an index can increase transaction costs, driving the ETF away from perfect index replication.

### Practical Scenario with Tracking Error  
Imagine an ETF that aims to track a corporate bond index. If certain bonds within the index are thinly traded or have wide bid-ask spreads, the ETF manager may not be able to replicate the exact holdings. This partial replication approach can introduce performance deviations.

### Minimizing Tracking Error  
• Choose ETFs with relatively low management expense ratios (MERs).  
• Evaluate the manager’s replication strategy. Full replication often provides tighter tracking than sampling.  
• Review historical tracking error data published by the ETF provider for consistency.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises when an ETF—or the securities that underlie it—is difficult to buy or sell without significantly influencing its price. While widely traded ETFs (like those that track major benchmarks) have robust liquidity, some niche ETFs with low daily trading volumes can present liquidity challenges.

### Impact of Low Liquidity  
• Wider Bid-Ask Spreads: When the trading volume is thin, investors may face higher transaction costs.  
• Price Volatility: With fewer buyers and sellers, even modest trades can cause noticeable price fluctuations.

#### Example: A Thematic Tech ETF  
A specialized ETF focusing on a narrow technology subsector may garner limited interest among investors. If you want to liquidate your position quickly during a downturn, you might accept a significantly lower bid price, thereby crystallizing losses.

### Strategies to Address Liquidity Risk  
• Check average daily trading volume before investing.  
• Use limit orders instead of market orders to control the execution price.  
• Maintain a diversified portfolio, reducing dependence on highly specialized ETFs.

---

## Concentration Risk

Concentration risk occurs when an ETF is heavily focused on a specific sector, theme, or geographic region. While this focus can deliver impressive upside if the sector performs well, it also heightens volatility and the potential for losses.

### Canadian Real Estate ETF Example  
A Canadian Real Estate ETF might hold positions in a dozen major real estate investment trusts (REITs). Should the real estate market decline—perhaps due to rising interest rates or an economic slowdown—unitholders might face disproportionately large losses compared to more diversified ETFs.

### Mitigating Concentration Risk  
• Balance sector or thematic ETFs with broader market ETFs.  
• Monitor economic indicators relevant to the sector, such as interest rates for real estate or commodity prices for natural resource ETFs.  
• Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain target exposure levels.

---

## Counterparty Risk

Some ETFs—particularly inverse or leveraged ETFs—rely on derivatives such as swaps or futures contracts. Under these agreements, the ETF is exposed to the solvency of the counterparty. If the counterparty defaults, the ETF may not receive the promised payment, resulting in losses.

    B -->|Uses Swaps, Futures| C(Derivative Counterparty)
    C -->|Exposure to Market| D(Market Prices)
```

### Canadian Example: Inverse Energy ETF  
Consider an inverse ETF designed to move opposite to Canadian energy stocks. If it uses swaps with a large bank (e.g., RBC or TD) as the counterparty, a financial crisis could, in extreme cases, jeopardize the bank’s ability to meet its obligations. While Canadian banks are known for financial stability, no institution is entirely free of credit risk.

### Managing Counterparty Risk  
• Review the ETF’s prospectus to identify derivative exposure.  
• Choose ETFs from issuers with robust risk management policies.  
• Keep track of the creditworthiness and regulatory environment of the counterparties.

---

## Currency Risk

ETFs that hold foreign securities, such as U.S. equities or global bonds, expose investors to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If the Canadian dollar appreciates relative to the currency of the underlying securities, the value of your ETF holdings may decline, unless the fund is hedged.

### Example: Investing in a U.S. Equity ETF  
• Suppose you invest in a U.S. Equity ETF listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). If the Canadian dollar strengthens against the U.S. dollar, your returns from the underlying U.S. stocks may shrink once converted back to CAD.  

### Hedged vs. Unhedged ETFs  
• Currency-Hedged ETFs: These use derivatives (like currency forwards) to mitigate exchange risk.  
• Unhedged ETFs: May yield higher returns if the foreign currency appreciates but amplify losses if the foreign currency weakens.

## Regulatory Considerations

Canadian investors benefit from robust oversight by organizations such as the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO). Key resources and guidelines include:

1. CSA Staff Notices address leveraged and inverse ETFs, informing investors of their complexities and potential risks.  
2. Some guidance from U.S. regulatory bodies like the SEC can also prove insightful, even though the Canadian framework differs.

By staying informed of regulatory updates, thoroughly reviewing ETF prospectuses, and understanding how each of these risks can impact returns, Canadian investors can better position themselves to manage the long-term implications of ETF investments.

## Practical Steps and Best Practices

1. Conduct Regular Reviews: Evaluate whether the ETF’s risk profile aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.  
2. Assess Portfolio Fit: Consider how an ETF’s concentration or liquidity profile interacts with other portfolio holdings.  
3. Diversify: Use a mix of ETFs (broad market, sector-focused, bond, and international) to spread out risk.  
4. Monitor Economic Indicators: In Canada, track Bank of Canada interest rate announcements, GDP figures, employment data, and commodity prices to anticipate potential market shifts.  
5. Seek Professional Advice: If uncertain, consult a qualified financial advisor familiar with Canadian securities regulations and tax rules.
