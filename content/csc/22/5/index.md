## 22.5 Listed Private Equity

Listed private equity refers to publicly traded companies or funds that invest in privately held businesses. These public listings allow investors to participate in private equity strategies while retaining daily liquidity through the public market. The following sections delve into the structure, risks, benefits, valuation methodology, and regulatory considerations of listed private equity in the Canadian marketplace.

---

### Introduction to Listed Private Equity
Historically, private equity has been an asset class open primarily to pension funds, institutional investors, and high-net-worth individuals. Traditional private equity vehicles often impose long lock-up periods and require significant capital commitments. However, listed private equity structures open the door for retail and smaller institutional investors to access these strategies.

In the Canadian context, listed private equity can function as:
• Corporations that hold stakes in private companies and trade on Canadian exchanges (e.g., the TSX).  
• Specialized closed-end funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of private equity opportunities.  
• Mutual fund-like vehicles offering exposure to private equity investments but structured to meet Canadian securities regulations.

---

### The Value Proposition of Listed Private Equity
By blending characteristics of both public markets and private equity, listed private equity seeks to offer:
1. Growth Potential: Private equity-focused funds often target companies with high growth capability or ones undergoing restructuring for potential value creation.  
2. Diversification: The private equity portfolio can act as a diversifier, reducing risk correlation relative to standard public equity investments.  
3. Liquidity: Shares of listed private equity trade daily on public exchanges, theoretically providing more liquidity than traditional private equity partnerships.

---

### Key Structural Variations
Listed private equity can manifest in different structures, each with its own risk-reward profile:

1. Corporate Holding Structures:  
   • A publicly listed corporation (e.g., Onex Corporation) that acquires and manages a portfolio of private businesses.  
   • Investors purchase shares, gaining exposure to the outcomes of the corporation’s underlying holdings.

2. Closed-End Funds:  
   • Function like traditional closed-end investment funds.  
   • Shares trade on the public market at premiums or discounts to net asset value (NAV).  
   • Portfolio managers actively buy and sell private stakes, employing leverage if needed.

3. Mutual Fund-Like Vehicles:  
   • Some firms structure private equity exposure through a mutual fund wrapper under Canadian securities regulations.  
   • Typically more common in markets outside Canada, but interest in these products is growing.

### Investment Process and Valuation Challenges

#### Investment Process
Fund managers or corporate managers typically:
• Identify private companies with high potential for growth, restructuring, or buyouts.  
• Conduct detailed due diligence, including financial statements, business models, and management teams.  
• Negotiate the terms of purchase; deals may involve equity stake acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, or mezzanine financing.  
• Oversee the investee company’s management strategy with active board representation, aiming to enhance value.

Below is a simplified diagram illustrating how a listed private equity structure invests in privately held companies:

    A(Individual Investors) -->|Buy shares on TSX| B(Listed Private Equity Company)
    B -->|Capital| C(Privately Held Businesses)
    C -->|Equity Ownership| B
    B -->|Potential Return| A
```

• Individual Investors (A) buy shares of the listed private equity company (B).  
• The company (B) deploys capital into privately held businesses (C).  
• In return, the private equity company (B) owns a stake in or entire control over these private businesses (C).  
• As the private businesses grow or become more profitable, the listed entity’s share value may rise, delivering returns to investors.

#### Valuation Challenges
While shares trade daily on a public exchange, the private equity portfolio’s real value may be updated less frequently. This can create a pricing mismatch, particularly during times of market stress. The public market price of the listed vehicle could diverge significantly from the underlying value of the private companies.

Examples of factors influencing valuation mismatches:  
• Market Sentiment: Negative market sentiment could drive the stock price down, even if private holdings remain healthy.  
• Limited Transparency: Private businesses have fewer disclosure requirements, hindering the market’s ability to accurately price the portfolio.  
• Periodic Appraisals: Underlying private stakes are often re-valued quarterly or semi-annually, while the stock trades every trading day.

---

### Risk and Return Profile
Listed private equity carries risks and rewards characteristic of traditional private equity, combined with the volatility of public markets:

• Higher Return Potential: Private equity strategies often target above-average returns through leveraged buyouts, growth equity, and turnaround strategies.  
• Liquidity Risk: Though the shares are publicly traded, daily volume can be low. In market downturns, it may be challenging to find buyers for large blocks of shares.  
• Leverage and Lock-Up: The listed vehicle may employ borrowed capital to amplify gains. However, high leverage can swiftly amplify losses. Some of the portfolio’s private investments may remain illiquid for extended periods due to lock-up agreements.  
• Manager Expertise: Performance heavily depends on the skill of the private equity manager, who must identify promising investments and oversee them effectively.

---

### Suitability Considerations
While listed private equity can make private equity accessible, it is not appropriate for every investor. Typical suitability factors include:

1. Risk Tolerance: Private equity is generally higher risk than traditional stocks or bonds. Potential swings in valuation may appeal only to investors who can withstand volatility.  
2. Time Horizon: Private equity strategies often require patience. Even though shares trade daily, longer holding periods may be necessary to realize full value.  
3. Investment Objectives: Investors aiming for growth and diversification beyond standard public equities may find listed private equity appealing.  
4. Regulatory Constraints: In Canada, these shares can reside in registered accounts such as RRSPs or TFSAs if the listing meets TSX or other recognized exchange requirements. However, always verify eligibility with your financial institution.

### Real-World Examples and Case Studies
• Canadian Pension Funds: Large public pension funds like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP) hold private equity portfolios, although not always in a listed format. Their successful track record highlights the potential of private equity.  
• ONEX Corporation: ONEX (listed on the TSX) manages private equity and credit platforms, showcasing how a publicly traded corporation can own and operate diverse private holdings.  
• Brookfield Asset Management: Though primarily known for real estate and infrastructure, Brookfield also operates private equity strategies, providing investors a partial window into private equity returns through its publicly listed shares.

---

### Best Practices and Pitfalls

#### Best Practices
• Thorough Research: Scrutinize the track record, fees, and governance structure of the listed entity.  
• Watch Leverage Levels: Examine how leverage is deployed in underlying investments and evaluate its impact on overall risk.  
• Continuous Monitoring: Like any public equity, listed private equity needs regular monitoring to assess changes in portfolio composition and market sentiment.

#### Common Pitfalls
• Over-Estimation of Liquidity: Public listing does not guarantee robust daily trading volume; large positions could be hard to liquidate.  
• Misinterpretation of Valuation: Market price may reflect overall investor sentiment rather than the actual worth of underlying private holdings.  
• Blind Reliance on Management: A high level of trust is placed in the management team’s ability to identify compelling opportunities and enforce value creation strategies.

### Summary
Listed private equity offers a pathway for Canadian investors to access the growth potential of private businesses through the convenience and liquidity of public markets.

Investors considering this asset class should thoroughly evaluate their risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and regulatory constraints before committing capital.

• Private Equity: Direct investment into privately held companies, often with a growth or restructuring focus.
