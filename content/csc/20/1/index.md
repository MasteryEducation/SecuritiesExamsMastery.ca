## 20.1 Introduction to Alternative Investments

Alternative investments have long been regarded as a powerful complement to traditional portfolios. Over time, institutional investors—including pension funds, endowments, and foundations—have adopted alternative strategies to diversify risk and potentially achieve enhanced returns. Today, accessibility to alternative investments has expanded to retail investors through vehicles such as registered alternative mutual funds (often referred to as “liquid alts”). While opportunities abound, navigating the complexities of alternative assets requires a clear understanding of the underlying structures, liquidity constraints, and regulatory frameworks guiding their use in the Canadian market.

## Scope of Alternative Investments

Alternative investments encompass a broad range of asset classes and trading strategies that are outside of the traditional categories of stocks, bonds, and cash. In the Canadian context, these may include:

• Hedge Funds  
• Private Equity and Venture Capital  
• Real Estate Investment Funds and Trusts  
• Commodities (e.g., precious metals, agricultural products, energy)  
• Infrastructure Funds  
• Managed Futures  
• Alternative Mutual Funds (Liquid Alts)  

Each of these categories has unique characteristics, including distinct regulatory oversight, liquidity structures, and performance drivers. While they may serve as powerful tools for risk diversification, they require a thorough understanding of their complexities.

## Rationale for Including Alternatives in a Portfolio

### Diversification

One of the principal motivations for introducing alternative investments is their potential to provide low or negative correlation with traditional asset classes. For instance, the performance of commodities or real estate funds may be influenced by economic fundamentals distinct from those that drive the equity or bond markets. As a result, adding alternatives to a portfolio may reduce overall volatility, smooth out returns, and help investors weather periods of stress in financial markets.

### Potential for Enhanced Returns

Many alternative strategies, such as hedge funds or private equity, focus on generating absolute returns—seeking positive performance in both rising and falling markets. While they can sometimes underperform in certain market conditions, their active strategies (e.g., long-short equity, arbitrage, special situations) may help capture opportunities not available to traditional, long-only portfolios.

### Access to Unique Markets and Instruments

Alternative investments offer exposure to markets and instruments that are typically inaccessible through conventional assets. For instance:

• Real Estate: Retail investors can participate in large-scale commercial and residential projects through real estate investment trusts (REITs) or private partnerships.  
• Commodities: Managed futures programs or commodity-focused funds allow investors to hedge inflation risk and capture returns from price movements in commodities.  
• Private Equity and Venture Capital: These funds invest in private companies poised for growth or undergoing major restructurings, offering potentially higher rewards at the expense of liquidity and transparency.

## Key Characteristics that Distinguish Alternatives

### Legal Structures

A significant number of alternative investment offerings are structured as limited partnerships or trusts (in contrast to the corporate structure typical of mutual funds). Examples include hedge funds and private equity funds. These structures can impact the way gains and losses flow to investors and have tax implications that differ from typical mutual fund distributions.

### Liquidity Constraints

Alternative investments often come with liquidity restrictions such as “lock-up periods,” during which invested capital cannot be redeemed. Even upon expiration of the lock-up, redemptions may be allowed only at specific intervals (e.g., quarterly or annually). By contrast, conventional mutual funds permit daily redemptions. This potential illiquidity is a trade-off for the unique strategies or underlying assets employed, which can themselves be illiquid or require longer time horizons.

### Regulatory Environment

In Canada, alternative investments fall under several regulatory frameworks:

• Alternative Mutual Funds (Liquid Alts): Regulated under National Instrument 81-102 (Investment Funds), but with more strategic flexibility around leverage, short selling, and derivatives usage than conventional funds enjoy.  
• Private Placements: Hedge funds and private equity vehicles offered via private placement are subject to appropriate prospectus exemptions under Canadian securities law, such as the “accredited investor” or “permitted client” exemption.  
• Derivatives Regulations: Entities using derivatives must adhere to regulatory guidelines, including margining and reporting requirements.  
• CIRO (Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization): Oversees the conduct of investment dealers and advisors, ensuring standards of practice and investor protection.

### Accreditation Requirements

Historically, alternative investments like hedge funds or private equity were available primarily to accredited (or “permitted”) investors—high-net-worth individuals or institutions that meet certain income and asset thresholds. The rise of alternative mutual funds (“liquid alts”) has broadened access for retail investors, provided they meet suitability and risk tolerance requirements as assessed by registered advisors and dealers.

## Evolution of Alternative Investments

### Institutional Beginnings

Public pension plans, large foundations, and endowments were early adopters of alternatives, aiming to diversify away from mainstream markets and capitalize on arbitrage or niche investment opportunities. The “Yale Model,” pioneered by Yale University’s endowment, famously allocated a substantial portion of its portfolio to alternatives and became a blueprint for many institutional investors worldwide.

### Retail Demand

The success achieved by institutional portfolios spurred increased retail interest in similar strategies. Canadian regulators, including the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and CIRO, have adapted product rules to allow alternative mutual funds, which:

• Offer daily liquidity similar to conventional mutual funds.  
• Are subject to National Instrument 81-102 but operate with expanded investment powers, including greater use of derivatives and short selling.  
• Provide a higher degree of regulatory oversight and transparency compared to privately offered hedge funds.

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Canadian Pension Fund Diversification

Consider a large Canadian pension fund (e.g., the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board - CPPIB). Over the last two decades, CPPIB has increased allocations to asset classes like private equity, real estate, and infrastructure. This diversification helped cushion the fund against equity market downturns and provided a more stable return stream to meet long-term liabilities.

### Case Study 2: Hedge Fund Strategies in Volatile Markets

A hedge fund managed by a team of former RBC capital markets professionals implements a long-short equity strategy focusing on Canadian resource stocks. During a period of elevated commodity price volatility, the fund’s ability to take both long and short positions reduces drawdowns and outperforms pure long-only commodity equities. This example highlights how an alternative approach can mitigate risk when deployed effectively.

## Visualizing Portfolio Diversification with Alternatives

Below is a simple Mermaid diagram illustrating hypothetical allocations in a balanced portfolio that includes traditional and alternative assets:

    A --> D(Alternative Investments<br/>(e.g. Hedge Funds, Real Estate, Liquid Alts))

    B --> G[Provides growth potential <br/> with moderate volatility]
    C --> H[Provides income and <br/> lower volatility]

This simple breakdown shows the concept of a multi-asset approach, where alternative investments sit alongside traditional equities and bonds, potentially smoothing returns.

## Step-by-Step Guidance on Evaluating Alternative Investments

1. Define Investment Objectives and Constraints  
   • Consider your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and liquidity needs.  
   • Clarify if the goals include outperformance or reducing portfolio volatility.

2. Determine Suitability  
   • Assess whether you meet the qualification (e.g., accredited investor) requirements for certain private alternative funds.  
   • For liquid alts, ensure compliance with National Instrument 81-102, focusing on risk classification and fund-specific mandates.

3. Conduct Thorough Due Diligence  
   • Examine performance track records, fees, and fund structures.  
   • Review risk disclosures, transparency levels, and the manager’s expertise.

4. Consider Liquidity and Portfolio Weighting  
   • Understand the lock-up periods or redemption terms if investing in hedge funds or private equity.  
   • Limit the portion of illiquid alternatives to ensure you can meet unexpected cash requirements.

5. Monitor Regularly  
   • Track alternative investments’ performance relative to stated objectives and market conditions.  
   • Remain vigilant about management style changes, regulatory shifts, or broader economic factors that may affect returns.

## Best Practices, Common Challenges, and Strategies to Overcome Them

• Document Your Investment Policy Statement (IPS): Develop a clear IPS that includes guidelines for alternative allocations, rebalancing triggers, and acceptable liquidity levels.  
• Beware of Leverage: Many alternative strategies employ leverage, amplifying both potential returns and losses. Monitor leverage ratios and stress-test your portfolio.  
• Understand Portfolio Correlations: While alternatives can offer diversification, correlations can shift during market crises. Use tools like statistical analysis (e.g., correlation matrices) to refine your allocations.  
• Mind the Fees: Alternative funds often employ performance-based fees (e.g., “2 and 20”—2% management fee, 20% performance fee). Compare fee structures and net returns among peers.  
• Stay Informed About Regulations: Regulations evolve as the Canadian market for alternatives matures. Regularly consult the CSA, CIRO, and official provincial regulator websites.  

---

## Glossary of Key Terms

• Absolute Return: An investment return with the goal of delivering positive performance in both rising and falling markets, measured on its own rather than against a benchmark.  
• Accredited Investor (Permitted Client): An individual or institution meeting certain net worth or income thresholds, allowing participation in private securities offerings that bypass public registration requirements.  
• Liquid Alts (Alternative Mutual Funds): Mutual funds regulated under National Instrument 81-102, with expanded investment powers (e.g., derivatives, short selling).  
• Correlation: A statistical measure ranging from –1.00 to +1.00 that shows how closely two assets move in relation to each other. Low or negative correlation suggests potential diversification benefits.
