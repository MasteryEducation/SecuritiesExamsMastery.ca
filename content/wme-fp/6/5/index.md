## 6.5 Impact of Divorce on a Client’s Financial Plan

Divorce is a significant life transition that can dramatically alter a client’s financial circumstances. Advisors who understand the interplay between legal obligations, emotional well-being, and financial planning strategies are better equipped to guide clients through this challenging process. In this section, we will explore the impact of divorce on net worth, liquidity, insurance and estate plans, retirement objectives, and more—primarily within the Canadian context.

---

### Changes to Net Worth and Liquidity

A divorce often leads to a reconfiguration of a client’s net worth and available liquidity. Several factors contribute to this shift:

1. Property Division  
   - In most Canadian provinces, marital assets (e.g., the family home, investment portfolios, and certain pensions) are subject to division.  
   - Forced sale of assets, such as a principal residence, may reduce total net worth, especially if the housing market is not favourable.  
   - Jointly held investment accounts may need to be liquidated or re-titled, which can trigger capital gains taxes or early redemption fees.

2. Child and Spousal Support Obligations  
   - Monthly child support or spousal support payments diminish disposable income, potentially delaying financial goals such as retirement or a home purchase.  
   - The spouse paying support may require more liquidity to meet support obligations, especially if payments are mandated for an extended time.

3. Legal Expenses  
   - Divorce involves legal fees, court costs, or mediation fees, further reducing savings or investable funds.  
   - Clients may tap into lines of credit or sell investments to cover these expenses, potentially incurring higher interest costs or loss of long-term growth potential.

Overall, a client’s post-divorce net worth is often lower and may come with new liquidity constraints. Advisors should model multiple scenarios to factor in unplanned expenses or delays arising from legal proceedings.

### Shifting Goals and Timeline

A divorce can fundamentally alter a client’s financial goals. Advisors, therefore, have to take a fresh look at timelines and target objectives.

#### Retirement Plans

• Reduced Savings Rate: Spousal support obligations, a division of retirement accounts, and legal fees can limit the ability to contribute to Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) or Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs).  
• Revised Lifestyle Expectations: Clients might need to adjust their expected retirement age and the lifestyle they can afford upon leaving the workforce.

For example, a client at RBC managing a balanced portfolio for retirement at age 60 may now need to postpone this goal to age 65 to budget for spousal support payments. Alternatively, they might decide to increase contributions, if feasible, to stay on track.

#### Education Savings

• RESP Contributions: If the separation changes a child’s primary residence or reduces a parent’s disposable income, contributions to a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) could decline.  
• Adjusting Income Splits: Divorced parents might renegotiate how to split future education costs, affecting overall planning strategies for the child’s post-secondary education.

#### Housing Plans

• Shifting Residency: One spouse could be forced to sell the matrimonial home and move, instantly changing housing costs and mortgage requirements.  
• Down Payments or Mortgage Refinancing: A client may need to refinance the existing mortgage under a single name or secure a new mortgage to purchase a separate property.

---

### Insurance and Estate Adjustments

Post-divorce, a client’s insurance and estate plans often require immediate review to ensure they remain current and aligned with new realities.

#### Beneficiary Designations

• Life Insurance Policies: Many couples list each other as primary beneficiaries; a divorce may prompt an immediate change to remove the former spouse.  
• Registered Accounts: RRSPs, RRIFs, and TFSAs often carry beneficiary designations that must be updated to prevent unintended asset transfers.

#### Wills and Powers of Attorney

• Executors and Guardians: If a former spouse was named as executor or guardian, the client may wish to name a different individual.  
• Estate Documents: Clients should promptly revise their wills and any Powers of Attorney (POA), ensuring they align with the new family and financial situation.

#### Joint Accounts and Policies

Untangling joint financial products is crucial to avoid unintended liability or entitlement. For example, a joint life insurance policy might require an adjustment to coverage limits, beneficiary designations, or even termination if no longer needed.

---

### Emotional and Psychological Factors

The emotional stress of divorce can influence decision-making and hamper objective financial evaluations. While advisors are not mental health professionals, it is important to acknowledge:

• Potential Decision Delays: The stress of separation may lead clients to postpone important financial decisions or neglect specific planning tasks.  
• Need for Referrals: Advisors should offer resources such as counseling or mental health support if a client’s emotional well-being significantly affects their financial planning.

Providing a supportive, empathetic environment can help clients stay focused on essential financial tasks, such as dividing assets or renegotiating insurance policies.

---

### Coordination with Other Professionals

Because divorce intersects legal, tax, and financial realms, multidisciplinary collaboration is often vital.

1. Family Lawyers  
   - Provide legal counsel regarding rights, responsibilities, and legal documentation.  
   - Oversee the drafting of separation agreements that define spousal support, child custody, and joint asset division.

2. Tax Experts  
   - Clarify which support payments are deductible and how property transfers are taxed.  
   - Offer strategic advice for mitigating capital gains taxes or for effectively splitting RRSP assets.  
   - Example: A tax expert might help clarify the taxable impact of transferring part of a spouse’s Registered Pension Plan (RPP) to the other spouse under a “rollover” provision.

3. Mediators or Collaborative Law Practitioners  
   - Canadian clients often seek collaborative divorce processes to reduce legal expenses and adopt a more constructive approach.  
   - Financial neutrals, such as CFP® professionals, can join mediation sessions to provide impartial analysis of assets and budgets.

### Practical Example: A Case Study

Consider a hypothetical scenario involving John and Linda, both aged 45, living in Toronto:

- Combined Assets:  
  • Family home valued at CAD 900,000  
  • Joint RRSP balance of CAD 200,000  
  • Joint TFSA balances of CAD 50,000  
  • Non-registered portfolio of CAD 80,000  

- Liabilities:  
  • CAD 400,000 mortgage on their principal residence  
  • CAD 20,000 personal line of credit  

When John and Linda decide to divorce, their net worth declines as they engage lawyers, forced to sell the family home in a slow housing market. Additionally, Linda is granted child support for their two children, reducing John’s disposable income. John’s timeline for retirement, initially planned at age 60, shifts to age 65. Linda updates her life insurance beneficiary from John to her sister, while both revise their wills to reflect their new circumstances.

This scenario highlights the interplay between asset division, liquidity, retirement planning, and immediate cash flow constraints.

### Visual Overview of the Divorce Financial Planning Process

Below is a simple flowchart illustrating key steps in managing finances after a divorce decision:

```mermaid

    A((Divorce Decision)) --> B[Identify Assets & Liabilities]
    B --> C[Engage Professionals (Lawyer, Mediator, Tax Expert)]
    C --> D[Negotiate Support & Property Division]
    D --> E[Update Financial Goals & Timelines]
    E --> F[Revise Insurance & Estate Plans]
    F --> G[Implement New Strategies & Monitor Progress]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**  
1. Upon deciding to divorce, the first step is to compile a list of all assets and liabilities.  
2. The client then coordinates with legal, tax, and financial professionals.  
3. After negotiating agreements around support and property division, the advisor helps the client revise their plans.  
4. Insurance, estate documents, and registration details (e.g., TFSA beneficiaries) are updated accordingly.  
5. Ongoing monitoring ensures the post-divorce plan remains on track.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• Maintain Detailed Records: Tax authorities or courts may require extensive evidence of each spouse’s assets and debts—keep meticulous documentation.  
• Revisit Budgeting and Cash Flow: Post-divorce income and expenses can shift dramatically, requiring detailed forecasting and scenario analysis.  
• Avoid Emotional Decision-Making: Hasty liquidation of key assets may cause unnecessary capital losses or tax liabilities.  
• Review Tax Implications Carefully: Consult with a tax specialist about the deductibility of spousal support (if paid periodically) and non-deductibility of child support to avoid compliance issues.  
• Update or Cancel Joint Financial Products Promptly: Failing to address joint liabilities can lead to credit disputes or unintentional beneficiary entitlements.
