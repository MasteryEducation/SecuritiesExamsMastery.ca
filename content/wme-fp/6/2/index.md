## 6.2 Fundamental Aspects of Family Law

Family law intersects significantly with financial planning and wealth management. As a financial planner, you will often advise clients on the economic implications of marriage, divorce, property division, and support obligations. Effective planning means understanding the fundamentals of Canadian family law, which varies from province to province. In this section, we will explore key principles governing family relationships, focusing on how legal frameworks guide the division of property, the obligations for child and spousal support, and the essential enforcement mechanisms.

## Provincial Jurisdiction over Family Matters

In Canada, most family matters—such as marriage formation, marital property division, child custody, and support obligations—are governed by provincial and territorial legislation. The federal Divorce Act governs divorce and related child or spousal support amid divorce proceedings, but issues like property division and enforcement often fall under provincial jurisdiction.

A few key points to note:

• Each province or territory has its own legislation and court system addressing family law issues.  
• While some principles remain broadly consistent across Canada (e.g., the “best interests of the child” for custody decisions), the specific rules and application can differ depending on the province.  
• As a financial planner, it is prudent to develop a network of family law specialists to navigate provincial differences effectively.

## Marriage and Divorce

### Legal Requirements for Marriage

Marriage rules differ slightly by province or territory, but generally include:

1. Age Requirements:  
   • The age of majority (18 or 19, depending on the province) must be reached, or the minor must have parental/guardian consent.  
   • Individuals under a certain age (e.g., under 16) cannot legally marry in Canada.

2. Consent:  
   • Both parties must willingly enter into the marriage.  
   • Factors like coercion, fraud, or mental incapacity can invalidate a marriage if consent was not freely given.

3. Compliance with Provincial Regulations:  
   • Couples must obtain a marriage license.  
   • A legally authorized person (e.g., clergy, judge, or justice of the peace) must officiate.  
   • Marriage ceremonies must adhere to provincial requirements for witnessing and documentation.

### Grounds for Divorce

Divorce in Canada is regulated under the federal Divorce Act. The primary ground for divorce is the breakdown of the marriage, which can be established in one of three ways:

1. Living Separate and Apart for One Year:  
   • The most commonly used ground.  
   • Spouses must live separate and apart for at least one year (they can still reside in the same home but act separately in daily life).  

2. Fault-Based Grounds:  
   • Adultery.  
   • Physical or mental cruelty.  
   These grounds are less common and typically more contentious, often requiring proof of misconduct.

### Custody and Access

When children are involved, custody and parenting arrangements remain paramount during and after the divorce process. Courts apply the “best interests of the child” standard, considering factors such as:

• The child’s emotional and physical well-being.  
• Stability and continuity in the child’s day-to-day life.  
• Each parent’s ability to provide proper care, guidance, and emotional support.  

Common arrangements include sole custody, joint custody, or shared parenting time. Financial planners should be aware of how these arrangements can impact child support obligations and overall family cash flows.

## Support Obligations

### Child Support

Child support follows the Federal Child Support Guidelines or relevant provincial guidelines, depending on whether the support stems from a divorce (federal) or separation between common-law partners (provincial). Key points include:

• Support amounts are determined primarily by the paying parent’s gross income and the number of children.  
• Special or extraordinary expenses—such as day care, medical expenses, or extracurricular activities—may be shared in proportion to the parents’ incomes.  
• Child support is generally non-taxable to the recipient, and non-deductible by the payer, though certain exceptions may exist.

Understanding child support is crucial in preparing a client’s financial plan, as it affects both short- and long-term cash flow projections. For example, an RBC or TD banking client receiving child support will want to plan how funds flow through their savings and investment accounts to cover child-related expenses.

### Spousal Support

Spousal support addresses the economic disadvantage one spouse may face following separation or divorce. Courts weigh multiple factors:

• The length of the marriage or relationship.  
• Roles played during the marriage, including child-rearing and career sacrifices.  
• Future income prospects and each spouse’s ability to be self-sufficient.  

The federal Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines may be applied by the courts as a reference to determine potential ranges for the amount and duration of support. Spousal support is typically taxable income for the recipient and tax-deductible for the payer if established by court order or written agreement, although the tax treatment can differ based on structuring (e.g., lump-sum vs. periodic payments).

## Property Division Principles

### Equalization or Division

In many provinces and territories, the law presumes that spouses share equally in property acquired during the marriage. Depending on the jurisdiction, this can take the form of:

• An “equalization” payment: Where one spouse with a higher net family property pays the other spouse an amount to equalize their net worth.  
• A division of property: Where the property itself is split between spouses on a 50/50 basis, subject to provincial rules.  

Financial planners often help clients inventory their assets and liabilities. Examples might include:

• Family homes or investment properties.  
• Retirement savings plans (RRSPs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), and employer-sponsored pension plans.  
• Non-registered investment portfolios or shares in privately held corporations.  

The division of these assets can significantly impact a client’s financial situation. Cash flow or risk levels can change if, for example, the client must increase contributions to a mortgage or comply with new property ownership arrangements.

### Exemptions

Some property—such as inheritances, gifts, or property owned before the marriage—may be partially or fully exempt, depending on the province and the nature of the property. However, increases in market value of these assets during the marriage may be subject to sharing. For instance, if a spouse owned 1,000 shares in a major Canadian bank (e.g., RBC) before marriage, the original share value might be exempt, but any appreciation during the relationship might be divided. 

If couples wish to protect specific assets from distribution, legal instruments such as domestic contracts or prenuptial agreements may clarify exemptions. As a financial planner, encourage your clients to seek legal advice proactively if they have unique or high-value assets prior to marriage.

## Enforcement Mechanisms

Many provinces have a Maintenance Enforcement Program (MEP) to ensure child and spousal support orders or agreements are upheld. Key enforcement tools include:

• Wage garnishments, where amounts are deducted directly from a payer’s salary.  
• Suspension of driver’s licenses or passports for significant arrears.  
• Registration of arrears as liens against property or other assets.  

For financial planners, it is important to understand that these mechanisms can affect wage allotments, business cash flows, or credit profiles when support obligations remain unmet. Clients who fail to comply risk significant legal and financial consequences.

## Practical Example and Case Study

Consider a married couple, Alex and Priya, who own a home in Ontario with a mortgage at RBC. Alex also holds a substantial Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), while Priya has a modest TFSA and invests in a TD non-registered brokerage account. After 10 years of marriage, they decide to separate:

1. Child Support: Alex remains the primary caregiver of their two children. Priya’s income is higher, so, under the Federal Child Support Guidelines, she must pay monthly child support.  
2. Spousal Support: Because Alex left a corporate career to look after the children, the court might award spousal support to Alex, reflecting the economic disadvantage from lost career progression.  
3. Property Division: Their matrimonial home, RRSPs, and brokerage accounts may be tallied to determine who owes an equalization payment. Priya’s inherited cottage may be partially exempt, but the appreciation in the cottage’s value during marriage may be considered in the equalization process.  
4. Enforcement: If Priya fails to pay child or spousal support, Alex can enlist the Ontario Family Responsibility Office to enforce the court order, potentially garnishing Priya’s wages.

From a planning perspective, each client’s cash flow, debt management, retirement strategy, and investment plan need adjusting to reflect child support, spousal support obligations, and asset division.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

• Collaborate with Family Law Experts: Work together with lawyers or mediators for clarity on provincial regulations.  
• Document All Assets: Encourage clients to maintain thorough records of their assets, including the date and cost of acquisition.  
• Update Estate Plans: Changes in family status frequently require updating wills, beneficiaries of RRSPs or TFSAs, and Powers of Attorney.

### Common Pitfalls

• Overlooking Future Obligations: Ignoring cost-of-living increases or “extraordinary expenses” for child support can create financial strain.  
• Inadequate Communication: Failing to coordinate with other professionals (e.g., accountants, appraisers, real estate agents) may result in incomplete advice.  
• Underestimating Tax Implications: Remember that spousal support often has tax consequences for both payer and recipient.
