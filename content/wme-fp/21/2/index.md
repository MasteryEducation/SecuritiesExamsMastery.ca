## 21.2 Types of Debt Securities

Debt securities form a vital component of many Canadian portfolios, offering predictable income streams and varying levels of risk and return. They can be an integral part of an investor's overall wealth management plan, as they provide diversification, capital preservation, and potential tax advantages when used appropriately. This section explores some of the most common types of debt securities found in Canada, outlining their essential features, benefits, disadvantages, and practical applications.

## Overview of Debt Securities

Debt securities represent a contractual agreement between an issuer (for example, the Government of Canada or a corporation) and an investor, wherein the issuer borrows a sum of money (principal) and agrees to repay it at a future maturity date. In return, the investor typically receives interest (coupon) payments at defined intervals, except in the case of zero-coupon bonds. Yield, credit quality, and tax status vary depending on the issuer, structure, and duration of the debt security.

Below is a mermaid diagram visually depicting various categories of debt securities:

## Government Bonds

### Federal Bonds (e.g., Government of Canada Bonds)
• These bonds are widely regarded as the safest form of Canadian debt instruments due to the full backing of the federal government.  
• Federal bonds come in various maturities (e.g., short-term, medium-term, and long-term).  
• They often carry lower yields than comparable corporate issues because of their relatively low default risk.  
• Suitable for risk-averse investors seeking steady income and capital preservation.

#### Practical Example
An investor nearing retirement may hold a significant portion of Government of Canada bonds to ensure capital preservation. For instance, RBC or TD might offer government bond mutual funds tailored for conservative retirement portfolios.

### Provincial and Municipal Bonds
• Sub-sovereign entities (e.g., provinces, municipalities) issue these bonds to fund infrastructure projects like public transportation or energy initiatives.  
• Provincial bonds typically yield slightly higher interest than federal bonds due to incrementally higher credit risk. Municipal bonds can carry higher yields than provincial issues but vary widely based on the issuer's creditworthiness.  
• Interest often qualifies for favorable tax treatments in some provinces, making them appealing investments for local residents.

#### Practical Example
School boards in Ontario or the City of Toronto might issue bonds for constructing new facilities. Investors willing to accept a moderate increase in risk (compared to federal government bonds) seek extra yield and potential tax benefits.

## Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

• T-Bills are short-term federal government debt, typically maturing in less than one year (commonly 3, 6, or 12 months).  
• Sold at a discount from par (face value). The difference between the discount purchase price and the par value at maturity represents the investor’s return.  
• Because T-Bills carry a short maturity, they are considered virtually risk-free and provide liquidity for short-term cash management needs.

### Example of Return Calculation

If a T-Bill with a face value of CAD 100,000 is purchased at CAD 99,000 and matures at par in 180 days, the investor’s nominal return is CAD 1,000.

You can apply the money market yield (also called the T-Bill yield) formula to estimate the interest rate:

{{< katex >}}
\text{T-Bill Yield} = \left(\frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}}\right) \times \frac{365}{\text{Days to Maturity}}
{{< /katex >}}

## Corporate Bonds

• Issued by corporations to raise capital for operations, mergers, acquisitions, or expansions.  
• Credit ratings and yields vary significantly based on corporate credit quality, economic environment, and time to maturity.  
  - Investment-grade bonds typically have higher credit ratings (e.g., BBB- or higher from S&P) and offer lower yields.  
  - High-yield (or “junk”) bonds carry lower credit ratings (below BBB-) and offer higher yields to compensate for greater default risk.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
• Research the company’s financial health, debt levels, and industry outlook.  
• Understand call provisions: Some corporate bonds contain call features allowing the issuer to redeem the bond early. This could create reinvestment risk for the investor.  
• Monitor industry trends, as sectors like energy or technology may face unique risks impacting bond prices.

---

## Convertible Bonds

• A hybrid security that grants the investor the right to convert the bond into a predetermined number of shares of the issuer’s common stock.  
• Convertible bonds usually offer lower coupons because the embedded conversion feature has value to the investor.  
• Attractive in bullish markets, as investors participate in potential equity upside while retaining bond-like downside protection (unless the issuer defaults).

### Step-by-Step Example of a Conversion

Suppose a company issues a CAD 1,000 par value convertible bond, convertible into 50 shares of the issuer’s stock at a conversion price of CAD 20 per share.  
1. If the stock trades at CAD 15/share, conversion is not beneficial. The bond remains a debt instrument with a coupon.  
2. If the stock price rises to CAD 25/share, the conversion value becomes 50 × CAD 25 = CAD 1,250, exceeding the bond’s par value of CAD 1,000. At this point, many investors would choose to convert.

---

## Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs)

• FRNs pay variable interest tied to a benchmark rate (e.g., the prime rate, CDOR [Canadian Dollar Offered Rate], or LIBOR for global issues).  
• Bond coupon payments reset periodically (e.g., quarterly), reflecting changes in the benchmark rate.  
• Advantageous in rising rate environments, as coupon payments usually adjust upward.  
• Yields may be lower when benchmark rates and credit spreads tighten.

#### Common Pitfall
FRNs can appear attractive in times of uncertain interest rates, but if rates fall, coupon payments also decrease—possibly impacting total returns.

---

## Zero-Coupon Bonds (Strip Bonds)

• Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; instead, they are issued (or sold) at a discount and redeemed at full face value at maturity.  
• The difference between the purchase price and the face value is the investor’s return.  
• Particularly useful for fixed-sum obligations at a future date, such as retirement needs or education funding.  
• Strips in Canada are often derived from bond “stripping,” separating the coupon payment streams from the principal repayment, and selling them separately.

### Example of a Strip Bond for a Specific Goal
A parent might purchase zero-coupon bonds to ensure a child's post-secondary tuition costs are covered in 10 years. The bond matures precisely when the funds are needed, offering a predictable lump sum.

---

## Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) and Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)

• MBS are backed by pools of residential or commercial mortgages. ABS are backed by various other receivables such as credit card debt, auto loans, or student loans.  
• Characterized by different tranches, with each tranche offering varied rates of return and risk levels.  
• Investors benefit from diversification and potential yield enhancement but face prepayment risk (if mortgages are repaid early, affecting interest payments) and default risk.  
• While MBS and ABS in the United States have been at the forefront of many discussions (especially following the 2008 financial crisis), Canadian MBS and ABS tend to have stricter underwriting standards, offering more stability. Still, due diligence is essential.

#### Canadian Case Study
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) issues mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government of Canada. Major Canadian banks, such as RBC, might pool insured mortgages and package them into MBS. These products often have lower yields compared to non-insured or private-label MBS but also carry less default risk.
