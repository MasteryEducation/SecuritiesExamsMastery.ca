## 14.2 Types of Annuities

Annuities can serve as a cornerstone in clients’ retirement portfolios, providing a predictable income stream and helping protect against outliving one’s savings. As Canadian demographics shift toward an aging population, the range of annuity products on offer continues to expand. Understanding these products is critical for financial planners aiming to design comprehensive retirement income strategies that meet individual client goals and objectives. Below, we explore the key types of annuities, examine their distinguishing features, and discuss how each product may serve particular retirement needs.

### Overview and Basic Structure of Annuities

In basic terms, an annuity is a contract between an individual (the annuitant) and a Canadian life insurance company. The individual pays a lump sum or a series of payments (known as premiums), and in return, the insurance company promises a stream of income over the annuitant’s lifetime or a fixed number of years. Annuities are subject to regulations overseen by bodies like the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) and provincial insurance regulators. For investment-related components—such as variable or indexed annuities—financial planners must also adhere to the guidelines set by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO).

Below is a simplified visual flow of how annuities function:

### Immediate Annuities

• Payments begin very soon after the premium is paid—usually within 12 months.  
• Attract retirees looking for a quick start to a guaranteed income stream.  
• Example: A 65-year-old client investing $200,000 in an immediate life annuity from a major Canadian insurer could begin receiving monthly payments right away. The exact payout depends on factors such as interest rates, life expectancy, and whether any guarantee period is included.  
• Best suited for:  
  – Individuals seeking immediate, stable cash flow.  
  – Clients who have already accumulated sufficient capital.  

#### Considerations and Best Practices

• Immediate annuities generally offer simplification: no need to manage investment allocations.  
• They can help address the risk of outliving one’s assets.  
• The trade-off is reduced liquidity; once the premium is paid, the capital is effectively locked into the annuity, barring limited surrender rights.

---

### Deferred Annuities

• Payments (the income phase) start at a specified future time, allowing investments to grow within the annuity contract.  
• Particularly appealing for clients still in their 50s or early 60s, who want to secure guaranteed income for later in retirement while deferring taxes on the growth.  
• Best suited for:  
  – Individuals desiring to build a pension-like income stream starting 5 or 10 years down the road.  
  – Clients with time to accumulate savings and benefit from compounding within the annuity product.  

#### Example: Planning for Future Income

A 55-year-old invests $100,000 in a deferred annuity offered by a large Canadian insurer such as RBC Insurance. Payments could be scheduled to begin at age 65. By deferring, any growth within the annuity remains untaxed until payouts start, potentially resulting in a higher monthly income than an immediate annuity purchased at the same age.

---

### Fixed Annuities

• Offer a predetermined, fixed rate of return or payment over the contract’s lifetime.  
• The insurer bears all the investment risk, ensuring consistent payouts regardless of market fluctuations.  
• Best suited for:  
  – Conservative clients who prioritize income stability over growth potential.  
  – Individuals wary of stock market volatility.  

#### Key Advantages

• Predictable income: a valuable benefit for budgeting and retirement planning.  
• Immunity to market drops, since the payout is fixed.  

#### Common Pitfall

• Payouts may not keep pace with inflation if living costs rise significantly. Planners often advise combining fixed annuities with other vehicles that have inflation-protection features.

---

### Variable Annuities

• Payments vary based on the performance of the underlying investment funds (sub-accounts).  
• Potential for higher returns, but clients bear the investment risk.  
• Best suited for:  
  – Individuals comfortable with market exposure.  
  – Clients seeking both guaranteed lifetime income features (riders) and growth potential.  

#### Practical Scenario

A 60-year-old invests in a variable annuity with growth-oriented sub-accounts linked to Canadian equity funds like RBC Canadian Dividend Fund or TD Canadian Equity Fund. Their monthly annuity payments could increase or decrease in line with fund performance, subject to any embedded guarantees or specified fees.

---

### Indexed Annuities

• Often linked to a market index (e.g., S&P/TSX Composite).  
• Offer a combination of fixed annuity security with some growth potential.  
• Most products feature caps or participation rates that limit both risks and returns.  
• Best suited for:  
  – Individuals wanting partial upside from equity markets while limiting downside exposure.  

#### Example of Index Participation

Suppose an indexed annuity offers a 70% participation rate in the S&P/TSX Composite and a 10% cap. If the index rises 12% in a given year, the annuity might be credited with 8.4% (70% of 12%), but the cap of 10% restricts any gains above that threshold. If the index declines, some contracts have minimum guaranteed returns, protecting the principal.

---

### Joint and Survivor Annuities

• Income continues to a designated survivor—often a spouse—after the primary annuitant’s death.  
• Typically, monthly payments reduce upon the first death (e.g., 60% or 75% of original payment), but some contracts maintain the same payment level for the survivor.  
• Best suited for:  
  – Couples seeking financial security for a surviving spouse.  
  – Individuals prioritizing lifetime coverage for both partners in retirement.  

---

### Guarantee Periods and Beneficiary Protection

Certain annuities include a guarantee period—such as 10 or 15 years—during which payouts are guaranteed to beneficiaries even if the annuitant dies. This feature addresses common concerns about “losing” the annuity’s value should an annuitant pass away prematurely. A 10-year guarantee ensures that, at a minimum, payments continue to beneficiaries for the remainder of that 10-year window.

---

### Matching Client Needs to Annuity Types

Each client has unique circumstances, including differing risk tolerances, liquidity requirements, and cash flow demands. For instance, a client who:

• **Wants immediate income** and has little tolerance for market risk might opt for an Immediate Fixed Annuity with a guaranteed period.  
• **Desires growth** and can tolerate market swings might consider a Deferred Variable Annuity.  
• **Is uncertain about longevity** but wants to protect their spouse or estate might select a Joint and Survivor Annuity with a minimum guarantee period.  

Below is a simple comparison table:

| Annuity Type            | Risk Profile        | Key Benefit                | Primary Concern                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Immediate Annuity       | Low                | Quick income start         | Irrevocable capital commitment    |
| Deferred Annuity        | Low/Mod            | Future income growth       | Must wait for payouts             |
| Fixed Annuity           | Low                | Guaranteed, stable amount  | Rigid, inflation risk             |
| Variable Annuity        | Moderate/High      | Potential for higher returns | Market-related volatility       |
| Indexed Annuity         | Low/Moderate       | Partial market participation | Caps/participation limits        |
| Joint & Survivor Annuity| Low/Moderate       | Spousal survivor benefits  | Often lower initial payout        |

### Summary

Annuities offer secure lifetime or fixed-term income—effectively transferring investment and longevity risk to an insurance company. The wide range of annuity products increases the likelihood of finding a solution tailored to a client’s unique retirement timeline, liquidity preference, and risk appetite. By integrating immediate annuities, deferred annuities, fixed options, variable investments, and specialized features such as inflation indexing or survivor benefits, advisors can craft nuanced strategies to meet retirement income goals. 

When recommending an annuity, it is essential to review factors like fees, surrender charges, inflationary pressures, and estate planning considerations. Encouraging clients to diversify their retirement income sources—such as Old Age Security (OAS), Canada Pension Plan (CPP)/Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), employer-sponsored pensions, and personal savings—helps mitigate the risk of relying solely on one income stream. 

Advisors must also remain mindful of evolving insurance product regulations, ensuring all disclosures and compliance requirements are met. Leveraging a holistic advisory approach, financial planners can help clients find the most suitable type of annuity to protect their retirement income for years to come.
