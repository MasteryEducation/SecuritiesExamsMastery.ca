## 20.1 Characteristics of Equity Securities

Equity securities—or simply “equities,” “stocks,” or “shares”—are foundational instruments in investment portfolios. They represent ownership in publicly traded corporations, both in Canada and worldwide. This chapter examines the defining features of equity securities, distinguishing between the main categories of common and preferred shares, and explores the sources of shareholder returns. We will also discuss legal protections, regulatory contexts, risk-return considerations, and best practices for analyzing equity investments in Canada.

### Introduction to Equity Securities

Equity securities entitle investors to a fractional stake in the issuing company. By purchasing shares, investors effectively become part-owners (shareholders). This ownership comes with:

• The possibility of benefiting from the company’s growth and profitability.  
• A say (often through voting rights) in significant corporate decisions.  
• The potential to receive dividends and realize capital gains.  

Equity investments can be volatile, as the market value of shares depends on numerous factors: from a corporation’s financial health and leadership to wider economic cycles and market sentiment. Despite periods of fluctuation, equities have historically provided significant growth potential over the long run.

### Common Shares

Common shares represent the most prevalent form of equity securities. They give investors partial ownership in a corporation along with voting rights (unless otherwise restricted by specific share classes). Key attributes of common shares include:

1. Voting Rights:  
   Common shareholders typically enjoy the right to vote on corporate matters such as electing the board of directors or approving major corporate transactions (e.g., mergers and acquisitions).

2. Residual Claim on Assets:  
   In the event of liquidation, common shareholders’ claims rank lower than those of preferred shareholders, bondholders, and other creditors. Common shareholders only receive assets after higher-priority claims have been satisfied.

3. Variable Dividends:  
   Dividends for common shares are not guaranteed. The board of directors decides whether to declare dividends based on factors like the company’s profitability, cash flow, growth strategy, and industry conditions.

4. Capital Gains and Losses:  
   If the market price of the share rises above the purchase price, shareholders may realize a capital gain by selling their shares. Conversely, a fall in share price can lead to a capital loss.

#### Example in the Canadian Context

Consider an investor who buys 100 shares of RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) at $120 per share. If RBC’s share price later rises to $130, the investor can sell the shares and realize a $10 per share capital gain, minus any transaction fees and applicable taxes. Additionally, if the RBC board declares a quarterly dividend of $1.32 per share, the investor would receive $132 every quarter until the dividend changes or the shares are sold.

---

### Preferred Shares

Preferred shares occupy a hybrid position between common shares and fixed-income securities. Here are some important characteristics:

1. Dividend Priority:  
   Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on dividends than common shareholders. While the dividend is not legally guaranteed, preferred shareholders often receive a fixed or pre-specified dividend rate if declared.

2. Priority in Liquidation:  
   In the event of corporate insolvency or liquidation, preferred shareholders rank above common shareholders in claiming the remaining assets (though still below bondholders and other debt holders).

3. Generally Non-Voting:  
   Preferred shares usually do not carry voting rights unless specific events or triggers (e.g., missed dividend payments) occur.

4. Variations of Preferred Shares:  
   • Cumulative Preferred Shares: Accumulate unpaid dividends to be paid in the future.  
   • Convertible Preferred Shares: Can be converted into a specified number of common shares.  
   • Retractable or Callable Preferred Shares: May be redeemed at the issuer’s or investor’s option.

#### Example in the Canadian Context

A Canadian investor might purchase preferred shares of a major utility company, such as Fortis Inc., to gain a predictable dividend stream. The fixed-rate structure of many preferred shares can be attractive for conservative clients seeking steady income, although this also means there is less opportunity for capital appreciation compared to common shares.

---

### Sources of Shareholder Returns

Equity investors may receive returns through:

1. Dividends:  
   • Derived from the company’s profits.  
   • Subject to periodic reviews, reflecting the company’s financial health and strategic outlook.  
   • Dividends for common shares can be halted or reduced if the company’s board decides the cash is better used elsewhere.  
   • Preferred dividends are more stable but not absolutely guaranteed.

2. Capital Gains:  
   • Occur when share prices rise above the initial purchase price.  
   • Realized gains are taxed in Canada at 50% of the gain (i.e., only half of the total gain is included in taxable income).  
   • Unrealized gains remain on paper until shares are sold.

3. Capital Losses:  
   • If the share price falls below the purchase price, investors may realize a loss upon selling.  
   • Realized capital losses can be used to offset realized capital gains and reduce tax payable on gains in the current year, or carried back or forward to reduce taxes in other years.

---

### Volatility and Risk Factors

Equity securities often experience higher price volatility than bonds or other fixed-income instruments. Reasons for this volatility include:

• Company-Specific Factors: Management performance, product launches, competition, and changes in industry dynamics can influence share prices.  
• Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, and global events may all impact equity valuations.  
• Investor Sentiment: Market psychology, news cycles, and speculative activity can also cause short-term price swings.

#### Case Study: Technology Sector Volatility

When a Canadian technology company, such as Shopify Inc., experiences rapid revenue growth and becomes a market leader, its share price might skyrocket. However, a negative earnings surprise or concerns over global supply chains can trigger a sudden correction in the company’s valuation. Equity investors need to be prepared for such volatility by maintaining diversified portfolios and regularly reviewing their holdings.

### Legal Protections for Equity Investors in Canada

Shareholders benefit from protections provided by both federal and provincial corporate statutes and securities laws. Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) oversees the harmonization of securities regulation across provinces. Key protections include:

• Mandatory Company Disclosures: Corporations listed on Canadian exchanges must publicly release financial statements, annual reports, and other disclosures filed on SEDAR+ (https://www.sedarplus.ca/).  
• Fair Trading Rules: Ensured by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) (https://www.ciro.ca/), which monitors investment dealers and mutual fund dealers.  
• Insider Trading Regulations: Strict rules against trading on material non-public information.  
• Enforcement of Fiduciary Duties: Directors and officers must act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

---

### Risk-Return Considerations

Equity investing can be lucrative but requires due diligence. Advisors and investors should consider:

1. Company Fundamentals:  
   • Balance sheet strength (e.g., debt-to-equity ratio).  
   • Profitability indicators (e.g., return on equity).  
   • Growth prospects (e.g., projected earnings).

2. Market and Industry Analysis:  
   • Competitive environment.  
   • Industry life cycle.  
   • Potential for disruptions (e.g., technological advancements, regulatory shifts).

3. Macroeconomic Conditions:  
   • Economic growth trends, monetary policy, foreign exchange rates.  
   • Geopolitical stability and trade policies.

4. Diversification:  
   • Reducing idiosyncratic risk by spreading investments across sectors, regions, or asset classes.  
   • Considering allocations to fixed income or alternative assets to mitigate equity market volatility.

5. Investment Horizon:  
   • Longer-term investors can ride out market fluctuations more easily.  
   • Short-term investors may not have enough time to recover from steep drawdowns.

### Best Practices and Practical Steps

When advising clients or managing personal portfolios, consider the following:

1. Conduct Thorough Research:  
   • Use multiple sources—SEDAR+ for official filings, open-source research tools like Yahoo Finance (https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/) or Morningstar (https://www.morningstar.ca/).  
   • Examine audited financial statements, management discussions, and relevant analyst commentary.

2. Stay Informed:  
   • Subscribe to corporate email alerts or news services.  
   • Monitor earnings releases, management changes, and industry updates.

3. Balance Income and Growth:  
   • Preferred shares tend to offer steadier dividends.  
   • Common shares can provide growth potential but can be more volatile.

4. Understand Tax Implications:  
   • Dividends from Canadian corporations are eligible for the dividend tax credit.  
   • Realized capital gains are taxed at 50% inclusion rate.

5. Remain Compliant with Regulations:  
   • Follow guidance and rules set by CIRO.  
   • Ensure all trades and recommendations meet suitability and disclosure requirements.

### Visualizing Equity Ownership and Claims

Below is a simple Mermaid.js diagram illustrating the claims hierarchy in corporate liquidation, highlighting where equity (common and preferred) shareholders rank in comparison to other stakeholders:

    A(Company Assets) --> B(Bondholders & Secured Creditors)
    B --> C(Unsecured Creditors)
    C --> D(Preferred Shareholders)

• Bondholders and secured creditors are paid first.  
• If any assets remain after unsecured creditors are satisfied, distributions go to preferred shareholders, and finally to common shareholders.

### Summary

Equity securities provide investors with an ownership stake in a company, the prospect of capital appreciation, and access to dividends when declared. Common shares typically come with voting rights and potential for higher returns but also face greater volatility. Preferred shares often appeal to those seeking more stable dividends and priority in liquidation but typically lack voting rights. Canadian regulators like the CSA and CIRO play essential roles in protecting investors through disclosure requirements, fair trading rules, and enforcement of fiduciary duties.

Financial planners should stress a balanced approach to equity investing, considering factors such as company fundamentals, industry outlook, economic conditions, risk tolerance, and the investor’s time horizon. By combining diligent analysis with prudent diversification, investors can harness the growth potential of equity markets while being mindful of the associated risks.
