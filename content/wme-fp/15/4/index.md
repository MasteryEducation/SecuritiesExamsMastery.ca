## 15.4 Powers of Attorney and Living Wills (Advance Health Care Directives)

In the realm of estate planning, the topic of Powers of Attorney (POA) and Living Wills—often termed “Advance Health Care Directives”—is crucial for safeguarding personal, financial, and healthcare decisions. By setting up a valid POA and preparing an advance health care directive, your clients can ensure that their financial assets and personal health choices remain under trusted supervision, even when they can no longer make these decisions independently.

This section provides a comprehensive look at:  
• Powers of Attorney and their scope under Canadian provincial laws  
• Differences between Continuing or Enduring Powers of Attorney and General Powers of Attorney  
• Living Wills (Advance Health Care Directives) and their role in expressing end-of-life and healthcare wishes  
• Practical guidance on the management of these documents in a broader wealth management context

## Understanding Powers of Attorney

### Definition and Purpose

A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal instrument used to appoint an individual—referred to as the “attorney” or “agent”—to make decisions on behalf of another individual, known as the “grantor” or “donor.” The POA ensures that financial, property, and in some cases personal care decisions can be executed properly if the grantor becomes mentally or physically unable to act independently.

Under Canadian law, each province has its own legislation governing the creation and scope of POAs. Examples include the Substitute Decisions Act (Ontario) and the Power of Attorney Act (British Columbia). While the precise requirements vary, common themes that carry across Canadian jurisdictions include:  
• The grantor must be legally capable when signing a POA.  
• The document must clearly outline the powers granted to the attorney.  
• The attorney must act within the boundaries of those powers and in the best interests of the grantor.

### Types of Powers of Attorney

There are typically two major categories:

1. Property (Financial) Power of Attorney:  
   - Grants authority to manage the grantor’s financial and property matters, such as maintaining bank accounts, paying bills, making tax filings, and handling investments.  
   - Often known as a “Continuing” or “Enduring” Power of Attorney if it remains valid even after the grantor becomes incapable.

2. Personal or Health Care Power of Attorney:  
   - Authorizes the attorney to make personal care and health-related decisions.  
   - May pertain to daily living arrangements, choice of healthcare providers, and other non-financial matters.

### Continuing or Enduring Power of Attorney vs. General Power of Attorney

• Continuing (or Enduring) Power of Attorney:  
  - Remains effective even if the grantor loses mental capacity.  
  - Highly recommended as it ensures no interruption in financial or personal care management when the grantor is incapacitated.

• General Power of Attorney:  
  - Usually ceases to be valid upon the grantor’s incapacity.  
  - Typically used for short-term situations, such as travelling abroad or delegating financial tasks for a limited timeframe.

The distinction is critical for estate planning. If a general POA is chosen and the individual becomes incapacitated, it may become void at a crucial time. Consequently, the courts might need to appoint a guardian or trustee to manage the grantor’s affairs, leading to significant delays and legal costs.

## Importance of Early Preparation

A POA can only be validly granted when the individual is mentally capable. Clients who procrastinate in creating a POA run the risk of waiting until they are already unwell or incapacitated, at which point they lack the legal capacity to grant a POA. Early preparation facilitates:

• Maintaining control. The grantor can choose who will manage their affairs.  
• Avoiding court-appointed guardianship. This saves money, time, and emotional stress.  
• Minimizing legal hurdles. A properly executed POA provides clarity and helps financial institutions (like RBC or TD) know who is in charge of the client’s accounts and assets.

## Living Wills (Advance Health Care Directives)

### Definition and Scope

A Living Will or Advance Health Care Directive is a written statement expressing an individual’s preferences regarding medical treatment, end-of-life care, and life support measures if they become terminally ill or permanently unconscious and are incapable of communicating. While the specific terminology varies by province, the following core elements remain consistent:

• Specifies desires for life-sustaining treatments, pain management, or palliative care.  
• Guides healthcare professionals and caregivers when the individual cannot speak or make decisions.  
• Reduces family conflicts by clearly documenting the individual’s choices regarding heroic measures or life support.

### Why Establish an Advance Health Care Directive

Living Wills mitigate the uncertainty and stress family members face when critical medical decisions are required. By outlining the client’s wishes in advance, doctors and family members have a concrete framework to follow, making it less likely that disagreements will arise. For instance, if a client explicitly states that they do not wish to remain on mechanical ventilation if there is no reasonable chance of recovery, medical professionals can act based on that directive.

## Role of Financial Planners in Guiding Clients

Financial planners provide a vital layer of support by advising clients on the financial ramifications of their choice of attorney and the management of Living Wills. Specifically, financial planners can:

1. Analyze the Financial Complexity for the Chosen Attorney  
   - Explore whether the named attorney has enough investment knowledge to manage portfolios, pay bills, and handle tax filing.  
   - For instance, if a client runs a small business or invests in complex securities like derivatives or alternative investments, the attorney should be comfortable managing those.  

2. Encourage Open Communication  
   - Clients should discuss their intentions with family members and trusted legal counsel.  
   - By fostering a transparent dialogue, the chosen attorney can seek clarifications on day-to-day tasks, from executing trades in RBC Direct Investing accounts to maintaining GICs at TD Canada Trust.

3. Document Storage and Accessibility  
   - Ensuring that original POA documents are stored in a safe, yet easily accessible location—like a safety deposit box or a secured digital vault.  
   - Advising on the distribution of copies to relevant parties, including lawyers, family members, or close friends.

4. Coordinate with Legal Professionals  
   - A financial planner should collaborate with a client’s lawyer to ensure all estate documents—POAs, wills, trust documents—align with the client’s overarching wealth management goals.  
   - Legal counsel can confirm that the POA meets provincial standards and properly incorporates any specialized clauses for business management or complex investments.

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

### Scenario: Managing a Complex Portfolio

Mr. Singh, a retiree with a well-diversified investment portfolio held at RBC Online Brokerage, wants to ensure continuity of his financial affairs. He appoints his daughter under a Continuing Power of Attorney for Property. Because she has a strong background in finance, she can handle complex tasks, such as rebalancing his equity holdings or rolling over GICs upon maturity. Should Mr. Singh develop severe cognitive impairment, the POA ensures his investments continue to be prudently managed without delay.

### Scenario: Health Care Directive in Action

Ms. Tremblay prepares a Living Will that explicitly asks her healthcare providers to avoid invasive treatments if her medical team deems that she has no chance of meaningful recovery. She shares this directive with her family doctor and her adult children. Upon a sudden stroke that leaves her incapacitated, the hospital refers to her directive. Her children do not face agonizing decisions regarding life-sustaining procedures because Ms. Tremblay’s instructions are clear.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

• Start Early: Clients should create a POA and Living Will before age-related health issues or serious illnesses arise.  
• Align Roles with Competencies: Select someone who has the skills, trustworthiness, and availability to carry out the role effectively.  
• Reflect and Update: Regular reviews (e.g., every few years or after significant life events) ensure that the documents remain up to date.  
• Seek Professional Advice: Encourage collaboration between financial planners, lawyers, and tax professionals to optimize results.

### Common Pitfalls

• Failing to Differentiate POA Types: Using a general POA when a continuing POA is needed can lead to invalidation upon incapacity.  
• Poor Communication: Surprising family members with a POA or Living Will at a crisis point can trigger conflicts.  
• Insufficient Document Storage: Lost or inaccessible documents, especially during emergencies, can nullify the benefits of an otherwise well-crafted plan.  
• Ignoring Provincial Differences: Overlooking local requirements—such as the need for specific witness rules—may invalidate the document.
