## 15.1 Passing on the Estate

Passing on the estate—a crucial stage of wealth management—entails ensuring that assets, and in some cases liabilities, are swiftly and correctly transferred to chosen beneficiaries. As a financial planning professional, you help clients organize their affairs so that their beneficiaries receive what they are entitled to with minimal delays and complications. This process heavily depends on having a valid will, maintaining comprehensive records, and aligning beneficiary designations with your client’s overall estate plan.

In this section, we explore the key steps of estate settlement, highlight various structures for asset distribution, discuss the importance of beneficiary designations, and provide insight on practical strategies to ensure a seamless transfer of wealth. We also include references to Canadian regulations, valuable resources, and best practices specific to Canada.

### Key Elements in Passing on the Estate

#### Estate Definition

The term “estate” encompasses both the assets and liabilities a person leaves behind at the time of death. Typical assets include real estate holdings, registered plans (like RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, and pension plans), non-registered investments, bank accounts, insurance proceeds, and personal items (e.g., art collections). Liabilities might include mortgages, unpaid bills, taxes, or credit card balances. Because estates vary greatly in size and complexity, thorough documentation and strategic planning are essential.

#### Executor (Estate Trustee)

An executor (also referred to as an “estate trustee” in some jurisdictions) is the legal representative responsible for gathering and protecting estate assets, paying off liabilities and taxes, and distributing the remainder of the estate following the instructions in the will or, in cases of intestacy, according to provincial/territorial law. The executor role can be assigned to an individual (e.g., a spouse, adult child, or close friend) or a corporate entity (e.g., a trust company).

Because acting as an executor involves a broad range of financial and legal responsibilities, it is wise for testators (the creators of the will) to select someone who has the time, organizational skills, and relevant knowledge. Executors often seek professional assistance from accountants, lawyers, and financial advisors to simplify tasks and ensure accuracy.

#### Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries are those who stand to gain from the estate’s assets—individual persons, organizations, or charities. The will typically identifies beneficiaries and indicates how the estate should be shared. However, certain kinds of property, such as registered accounts (RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs) or insurance policies, often bypass the will altogether and fall directly to named beneficiaries. This direct transfer can reduce probate fees and delays.

### Ensuring a Smooth Estate Transfer

#### Organizing Financial Affairs

Clients should keep accurate, up-to-date records of their entire financial picture. Key items include:

• An up-to-date will that reflects current wishes.  
• Insurance policies and their beneficiaries.  
• Registered accounts (RRSP, RRIF, TFSA) with beneficiary designations.  
• Asset inventory (real estate deeds, investment accounts, business interests, personal assets, etc.).  
• Liabilities (e.g., mortgages, credit lines) and relevant documentation.  
• Funeral instructions or pre-paid funeral arrangements.  
• Location of important legal documents or digital credentials (e.g., passwords, online bank accounts).

In practice, maintaining a secure binder or electronic folder containing all vital documents is a powerful strategy. Clients often rely on password manager applications or encrypted digital vaults to store account passwords and instructions for electronic assets. For smaller estates, open-source spreadsheet tools (available from provincial legal clinic websites or consumer advocacy organizations) can be a helpful starting point for creating a comprehensive asset summary.

#### Importance of a Valid Will

A valid and up-to-date will is the cornerstone of estate planning. Each province and territory in Canada has specific rules that govern the preparation and execution of a will. While it is possible to draft a will without professional help, the legal complexity usually justifies, and in more complicated cases all but demands, the involvement of an estate lawyer (or a notary in Quebec).

In the absence of a valid will, “intestacy” rules dictate how assets are distributed. These rules aim to approximate what most would consider a fair outcome—largely prioritizing spouses, common-law partners, and children—but they rarely mirror your client’s personal preferences precisely. Consequently, you should urge clients to have a formal will to direct assets in line with their unique wishes.

#### Joint Ownership Structures

Joint ownership can avoid probate and expedite asset transfers, but it also introduces estate planning issues if not utilized carefully. The two principal property ownership structures are:

• Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS): On the death of one co-owner, the surviving tenant automatically acquires full ownership of the property. This structure bypasses probate and does not form part of the deceased’s estate.  
• Tenants in Common: Each co-owner holds a distinct proportion of the property. The deceased co-owner’s share becomes part of their estate, passing according to the will or intestacy laws. This structure offers less automatic survivorship but may better align with your client’s specific estate distribution wishes.

Balancing potential probate savings against potential disputes or unintended consequences (e.g., property claims from extended family members) is crucial. Clients should also weigh exposure to creditors or legal claims against the benefits of joint ownership.

#### Beneficiary Designations

Registered investments (RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, pension plans) and insurance policies can bypass the estate via named beneficiaries. This arrangement can lead to faster payouts and fewer probate fees. When advising clients, emphasize:

• Updating beneficiary designations after major life events (e.g., marriage, divorce, birth of a child).  
• Keeping backup beneficiaries to address unexpected situations where a beneficiary predeceases the testator.  
• Confirming that designations remain valid in each province/territory.  
• Understanding that naming “Estate” as a beneficiary funnels the asset into the estate, potentially subjecting it to probate and creditor claims.

#### Settling Outstanding Debts and Funeral Costs

Debts must be satisfied before distributions occur. Executors need to:

• Identify all liabilities, including credit card debts, mortgages, car loans, lines of credit.  
• Pay final income taxes, ensuring no outstanding amounts are due to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).  
• Plan for funeral and burial costs. In some cases, the estate can claim these expenses when filing the final tax return.

Discussing funeral preferences ahead of time—whether to hold a simple memorial service or something more elaborate—can prevent additional stress for bereaved family members. Some clients opt for prepaid funeral arrangements, removing a significant administrative burden from executors.

### The Advisor’s Role in Passing on the Estate

#### Education and Facilitation

Financial planners play a pivotal role in explaining the intricacies of estate settlement. By reminding clients to update their wills, beneficiary designations, and plan structures regularly, you help minimize later disputes and delays. You may propose specialized estate structures—such as testamentary trusts—that can streamline administration and provide important benefits like income splitting and protection for minors or dependents.

#### Collaborating with Estate Lawyers or Notaries

Canadian estate laws differ by province, and complex estates typically require specialized legal advice. Encourage clients to consult a licensed estate lawyer or a notary (in Quebec) to review wills, establish trusts, and resolve any estate-related complexities. By maintaining a network of reputable legal experts, you can provide referrals to address advanced estate planning scenarios effectively.

#### Canadian Context for Estate Administration

Each province has its own legislation governing wills, estate administration, and probate. For example, Ontario’s Ministry of the Attorney General oversees the probate process known as the “Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee,” while British Columbia follows the Wills, Estates and Succession Act (WESA). Professionals must be cognizant of each province’s unique rules. Staying informed about regulatory changes can help you offer sound, up-to-date advice.

### Practical Example: Smooth Estate Transition

Consider a client named Sandra, who has the following structure:

• A valid will naming her adult son as executor.  
• RRSP and TFSA each named her daughter as beneficiary.  
• Joint ownership on a secondary vacation condo with her spouse.  
• A small business, partially funded by an RBC business line of credit.  

Upon her passing, the RRSP and TFSA transfer directly to her daughter, bypassing probate. The vacation condo remains with her spouse through rights of survivorship. The business requires attention: Sandra’s son, acting as executor, will repay the RBC line of credit from estate funds before distributing any remaining business assets or proceeds to the other beneficiaries. Sandra’s organized structure and clear documentation enable her executor to settle liabilities, handle probate for certain assets, and ensure prompt distribution to her beneficiaries with minimal complexity.

### Diagram: Estate Settlement Process Overview

Below is a simplified illustration of how assets and liabilities flow during the estate settlement process:

```mermaid

    A((Death of Individual)) --> B[Locate Will & Executor]
    B --> C{Executor Identifies Assets & Liabilities}
    C -->|Assets Identified\n(Accounts, Property)| D[Pay Debts & Taxes]
    C -->|Liabilities: Mortgages\nCredit Cards| D
    D --> E[Distribute to Beneficiaries]
    E --> F((Estate Closed))
```

Explanation of Diagram:  
1. Upon the individual’s passing, the will is located, and the executor named in the will becomes responsible for the estate.  
2. The executor compiles an inventory of estate assets and identifies liabilities.  
3. Liabilities such as mortgages and taxes are paid first from available estate funds.  
4. After obligations are met, the remaining assets are distributed to intended beneficiaries, leading to estate closure.

### Best Practices and Potential Pitfalls

• **Regular Updates:** Wills and beneficiary designations can become outdated quickly, particularly after marriages, divorces, births, or deaths in the family. Recommend that clients review these documents every few years or whenever they experience major life changes.  
• **Executor Preparedness:** Encourage clients to discuss estate administration details with their chosen executor. Surprises, such as hidden assets, unrecorded debts, or unfamiliar digital accounts, can stall estate settlement.  
• **Tax Considerations:** Estates in Canada may be subject to probate fees, capital gains taxes on deemed dispositions, and other relevant taxes. Failing to plan adequately can reduce the net wealth that passes to beneficiaries.  
• **Complex Family Dynamics:** Second marriages, blended families, and dependent adult children can greatly influence estate plans. It is crucial that clients structure the estate to balance fairness and clarity.  
• **Overlooking Digital Assets:** In the era of online banking, social media, and digital investments (e.g., cryptocurrencies), clients must ensure their estate plan addresses intangible assets and access requirements.
