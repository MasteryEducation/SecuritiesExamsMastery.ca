## 23.3 Wrap Products

In the Canadian wealth management landscape, wrap products—sometimes referred to as wrap accounts or separately managed accounts (SMAs)—present a bundled, fee-based approach to investing and portfolio management. By charging a single, all-inclusive “wrap” fee for multiple services, these products simplify client billing and administrative headaches. Below, we explore how wrap accounts work, their core features, potential benefits, pitfalls, and best practices for effectively integrating them into a comprehensive financial plan.

---

### Introduction to Wrap Products
A wrap program is typically an all-in-one solution for clients seeking to delegate and simplify their portfolio management. Such programs often include:  
• Asset allocation.  
• Professional portfolio management.  
• Trading costs.  
• Ongoing advisory services.  

Clients pay a single annual or quarterly percentage of the assets under management (AUM) for these bundled services, known as the “wrap fee.” This model can be particularly appealing for investors who value the convenience of integrated management, consolidated reporting, and portfolio customization.

---

### Defining the Wrap Structure

Wrap accounts revolve around the idea that **simplicity** adds value. Rather than billing separately for each transaction, consultation, or administrative task, clients receive a single consolidated statement. This approach was popularized in Canada in the 1990s and has since evolved to address diverse client demands—from more conservative retirees to growth-oriented families.

**Key features often included** in a wrap arrangement:  
1. A detailed asset allocation strategy, frequently driven by the client’s risk profile.  
2. Continuous monitoring and rebalancing of the portfolio.  
3. Access to multiple asset classes, including equities, fixed income, and alternative investments.  
4. An integrated advisory relationship offering holistic solutions, such as financial planning, tax efficiency strategies, and estate planning support.  
5. A single comprehensive fee covering commissions, management expenses, and advisory costs.

---

### Single-Style vs. Multi-Style Wrap Offerings

Despite the unified structure, wrap products can differ significantly in their configurations:

1. **Single-Style Wrap**  
   • Focus on one investment style or a single portfolio manager.  
   • Suited for investors who believe a particular style—e.g., growth, value, dividend, or balanced—aligns well with their goals.  
   • Tends to be more straightforward to track, as only one manager is responsible for performance and transactions.

2. **Multi-Style Wrap**  
   • Combines multiple managers or strategies within the same product.  
   • Seeks diversification across asset classes, geographical regions, or managerial approaches (e.g., combining a value manager with a growth manager).  
   • Often employs an “overlay manager” who oversees allocations among sub-managers, ensuring target risk levels are maintained.

Multi-style wrap accounts can help mitigate the “style drift” phenomenon (where an investment manager strays from their stated style) by providing alternative pillars of performance. Nevertheless, multi-style wraps may involve more complex (and potentially higher) wrap fees.

---

### Wrap Fee Structures

The defining feature of a wrap account is the establishment of a single, all-encompassing fee. This fee is typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. For example, a client might pay 1.75% annually, deducted proportionally each quarter. This charge generally includes:  
• Ongoing advice and portfolio oversight.  
• Investment management (outsourced or in-house).  
• Trading costs, such as commissions and spreads.  
• Reporting and administrative costs.  

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
Although transparent and straightforward, wrap fees may be relatively high if the underlying strategies are actively managed or if multiple specialized sub-managers are employed. Advisors should assess whether the holistic advantages of customization and convenience outweigh slightly higher costs relative to cheaper alternatives, such as basic index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

---

### Aligning Wrap Accounts with Client Objectives

An effective wrap arrangement goes beyond mere convenience. The program should align with the client’s overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. In Canada, many advisors employ detailed **risk questionnaires** or “Know Your Client” (KYC) documentation to map out:

• The client’s comfort with market volatility.  
• Short-, medium-, and long-term investment goals (e.g., purchasing a home, saving for education, preparing for retirement).  
• Constraints such as liquidity needs, ethical investing preferences (e.g., responsible investment strategies), and tax considerations.

This emphasis on suitability and customization can be one of the greatest strengths of wrap products.

---

### Portfolio Customization and Curation

A unique advantage of wrap programs is the possibility of tailoring investment choices to the specific needs of the investor. For instance:

• **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) filters:** Clients may request investment mandates that exclude certain industries or prioritize sustainable companies.  
• **Tax Efficiency:** Higher-net-worth Canadians may have complex tax scenarios involving trusts or corporations, requiring portfolio structures that minimize tax liabilities.  
• **Concentrated Positions:** Clients who own significant holdings in their employer’s stock (e.g., employees of RBC, TD, or other major Canadian corporations) may require additional diversification measures.  

Therefore, the portfolio under a wrap arrangement can be curated much more precisely compared to generic mutual funds.

---

### Simplified Reporting and Performance Tracking

One of the most attractive features of wrap products is **simplified reporting**. Rather than receiving multiple statements from various funds or managers, the client receives a consolidated monthly or quarterly statement summarizing:

• The total market value of their investments.  
• Contributions, withdrawals, and portfolio gains/losses.  
• Manager changes or rebalancing transactions.  
• Ongoing performance metrics, such as time-weighted rates of return or net-of-fee returns.  

This level of consolidation improves transparency and often enhances the advisor-client communication process. Simplified reporting also makes it easier for clients to follow long-term performance trends, rather than getting lost in the details of multiple management statements.

---

### Potential Advantages

Clients choosing wrap accounts typically cite the following benefits:

1. **Transparency of Costs**  
   All advisory, management, and transaction costs are combined, eliminating surprise fees.  

2. **Ease of Use**  
   A single account statement and payment structure reduces administrative burdens for both the client and advisor.  

3. **Professional Management**  
   Access to specialized portfolio managers and advanced asset allocation techniques can support more robust, goal-oriented investing.  

4. **Alignment with Financial Plan**  
   Advisors often use wrap programs to ensure the client’s portfolio remains coherent with their insurance, tax, and estate strategies.

5. **Ongoing Rebalancing**  
   Wrap managers can systematically rebalance the portfolio as market conditions shift, preserving the established risk profile.

---

### Possible Drawbacks and Considerations

Despite their advantages, wrap accounts are not suitable for every type of investor. Key considerations include:

1. **Fee Levels**  
   Wrap fees can be higher than costs for self-directed brokerage accounts, particularly for investors with low trading volume or simpler needs.  

2. **Inflexibility**  
   Some wrap programs have a limited menu of managers or investment strategies, which may not be the best fit for niche needs.  

3. **Complexity**  
   Multi-style wraps can be more challenging to understand, especially when multiple sub-managers are involved—potentially causing confusion about accountability for returns.  

4. **Minimum Investment Requirements**  
   Many wrap programs require higher minimum balances (e.g., $100,000 or more), excluding smaller accounts from participation.

---

### Regulatory Context and Compliance

Within the Canadian regulatory framework, wrap products must meet the same suitability and disclosure standards as any other investment vehicle. Key regulatory bodies and guidelines include:

1. **Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO)**  
   • Formerly IIROC and MFDA.  
   • Provides compliance resources for registered representatives regarding fee-based accounts.  
   • Mandates proficiency rules ensuring that advisors recommending wrap arrangements have the proper credentials, training, and experience.

2. **Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)**  
   • “Client Focused Reforms” under NI 31-103 guide how fees and conflicts of interest should be disclosed to clients.  
   • Emphasizes the importance of transparent fee disclosures and identifying any conflicts arising from the wrap fee structure.

3. **KYC and Suitability Requirements**  
   • Advisors must collect thorough personal and financial information from clients to confirm wrap suitability.  
   • Ongoing monitoring is mandatory to ensure that changing life circumstances or market conditions do not render the product inappropriate.

4. **Conflict of Interest Provisions**  
   • Advisors must articulate how they address any potential conflicts, such as receiving higher remuneration for recommending certain sub-managers within the wrap program.

Because clients are effectively delegating a wide range of decisions under a wrap agreement, it is crucial that advisors communicate the details of the fee, manager selection, and overall expectation of service.

### Real-World Example and Case Study

Consider an affluent family approaching a major Canadian bank—such as RBC—with $1 million to invest. They desire a long-term growth strategy but have distinct preferences for environmental sustainability and moderate risk. After completing a comprehensive risk questionnaire, the advisor and client agree on a multi-style wrap program featuring:

• **Canadian Equity Manager** specializing in ESG-friendly dividend-paying companies.  
• **Global Equity Manager** focusing on sustainable growth stocks.  
• **Fixed Income Manager** for stability and income generation.  

All managers and associated trading costs are consolidated under a 1.5% wrap fee on assets under management. The family receives quarterly statements depicting aggregated performance and fees. Any rebalancing or portfolio additions are handled internally, without extra charges. Over time, the family enjoys consistent oversight and a convenient, single line of communication with their primary advisor.

    C --> E[Portfolio Management]
    C --> F[Trading & Reporting]
    C --> G[Sub-Managers (if Multi-Style)]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**  
1. The client pays a single wrap fee to the advisor/dealer.  
2. This fee covers multiple components, including advice, portfolio management, trading, and any sub-managers if it is a multi-style arrangement.

### Implementation Tips and Best Practices

1. **Detailed Risk Profiling**  
   Ensure every wrap client undertakes robust KYC and risk profiling. A mismatch between client risk tolerance and the selected wrap strategy can jeopardize trust and performance.

2. **Ongoing Communication**  
   Relationships drive success in fee-based models. Frequent check-ins to discuss life events, evolving financial goals, or market changes foster client satisfaction and retention.

3. **Unbundled Cost Comparison**  
   Before finalizing a wrap agreement, demonstrate the relative cost of unbundled services (e.g., management fees, trading costs, advisor fees) to confirm the wrap fee is fair.

4. **Manager Due Diligence**  
   For multi-style wraps, conduct regular due diligence on sub-managers. Ensure alignment with the client’s objectives and continuous compliance with the overarching investment policy statement (IPS).

5. **Compliance Documentation**  
   Maintain thorough documentation of recommendations, communications, and KYC information to meet CIRO regulatory standards and demonstrate transparency.

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

• **Overconcentration of Assets:** Even in a multi-style wrap, ensure genuine diversification and prevent overexposure to a single sector or asset class.  
• **Neglecting Tax Efficiency:** Some wrap managers may rebalance frequently, triggering undue capital gains, which can reduce net returns for taxable portfolios.  
• **Underestimating Client Communication Needs:** Clients drawn to wraps often value transparency and a relationship-focused approach. Insufficient communication can erode trust.  
• **Insufficient Due Diligence on Underlying Managers:** If sub-managers within the wrap fail to perform or deviate from their stated mandates, it can undermine the holistic strategy.

---

### Glossary

• **Wrap Fee:** A single, all-inclusive fee covering portfolio management, trading commissions, and advice.  
• **Separately Managed Account (SMA):** A private portfolio managed according to the specific needs and objectives of the individual client.

### Summary

Wrap products can be an excellent solution for Canadians who want to simplify investment management, benefit from a tailored approach, and maintain close collaboration with their advisor. By bundling multiple services—portfolio management, asset allocation, and trading costs—into a single fee, wrap accounts deliver transparency and convenience. Yet, advisors must evaluate their client’s unique needs, risk tolerance, and cost sensitivity when recommending a wrap solution. In an evolving regulatory environment, wrap providers should maintain clear communication, ongoing client reviews, and thorough compliance oversight.

Whether a single-style or multi-style program, wrap solutions offer a powerful avenue for aligning investment portfolios with broader wealth management goals—so long as clients and advisors choose the right structure and remain engaged in an ongoing dialogue about performance, fees, and objectives.
