## 19.3 Strategic Asset Allocation

Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) is a cornerstone of portfolio management. It involves defining a long-term “policy portfolio” that aligns with an investor’s objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon. By setting specific weightings for asset classes like equities, fixed income, cash, and alternative investments, advisors and investors can target an expected return range while managing volatility. This structured approach helps investors remain disciplined, mitigating the risk of making impulsive and emotionally driven decisions during market volatility. In the Canadian context, strategic asset allocation must consider the regulatory environment, as well as the unique characteristics of local assets and institutions.

### Definition and Purpose of Strategic Asset Allocation

Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) is the process of determining and maintaining a long-term target mix of asset classes. Because it is tied to fundamental client goals and constraints (e.g., retirement needs, funding post-secondary education, estate planning), the result is often referred to as a “policy portfolio.” The policy portfolio provides a clear framework or baseline for investment decisions.

1. **Foundation in Objectives and Constraints:**  
   - Each client’s future liabilities (e.g., mortgage payments, children’s education) and risk tolerance (often indicated by questionnaires or thorough discussions) lead to determining the ideal long-term weightings for asset classes such as Canadian equities, global equities, fixed income, or alternative strategies.  
   - For instance, a client with a medium- to long-term goal (10+ years) and moderate risk tolerance may have a policy portfolio of 60% equities and 40% fixed income.

2. **Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions:**  
   - SAA is driven by expectations (projections) for asset class returns, volatility, and correlation.  
   - These assumptions are typically derived from historical data, economic outlooks, and forward-looking market analysis. Leading asset management firms (including RBC Global Asset Management or TD Asset Management) often publish annual or quarterly market outlooks that include expected returns for Canadian, U.S., and global asset classes.

3. **Stable Over Time, but Flexible to Changing Needs:**  
   - While the policy portfolio is relatively stable, it is not set in stone. Major shifts in an investor’s life, market, or regulatory conditions can necessitate adjustments to maintain alignment with goals.  
   - For example, a working professional approaching retirement may shift from a 70% equity/30% fixed income mix to a 50% equity/50% fixed income mix over time to reduce volatility risk.

---

### The Long-Term Perspective

A key hallmark of SAA is its focus on the long term, typically spanning years or even decades. This horizon allows investors to see beyond day-to-day market fluctuations and harness the power of compounding returns:

1. **Reduced Frequency of Changes:**  
   - Unlike tactical asset allocation, which might involve frequent repositioning based on short-term market outlooks, SAA emphasizes consistency.  
   - Significant allocation changes are usually reserved for major life events (e.g., retirement, job loss, inheritance) or fundamental changes in the markets (e.g., structural shifts caused by technology or global events).

2. **Harnessing Compounding:**  
   - By maintaining a consistent allocation to growth-oriented assets (e.g., equities), investors can potentially benefit from compounding returns over the long run.  
   - Institutional investors in Canada, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), largely depend on long-term strategic allocations to equities, fixed income, and alternative investments (e.g., real estate, private equity) to meet obligations far into the future.

3. **Focus on Policy Portfolio Returns:**  
   - Portfolio performance is generally evaluated against benchmark indexes or a blend of benchmarks reflective of the strategic mix.  
   - The aim is not to chase short-term outperformance but to ensure the portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns remain in line with expectations.

---

### Expected Return and Risk Profile

A principal objective of SAA is to ensure the portfolio’s expected return meets or exceeds the investor’s long-term goals while the associated risk remains within an acceptable range:

1. **Balancing Risk and Return:**  
   - Typically, a balanced portfolio, such as 60% equities and 40% fixed income, might offer moderate growth with moderate volatility.  
   - Increasing the equity weighting (e.g., 80% / 20%) increases the expected return but also amplifies the potential downside risk.

2. **Quantifying Volatility:**  
   - Advisors often use standard deviation or Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures to represent potential fluctuations in portfolio returns.  
   - Equities generally exhibit higher volatility than fixed income, making it crucial to set equity allocations in line with the client’s willingness and ability to endure market swings.

3. **Correlations and Diversification:**  
   - SAA also takes into account correlations between asset classes. If asset classes move in tandem (i.e., correlate highly), risk is less diversified.  
   - Canadian investors often add global equities to reduce local market concentration risk, as domestic equities (TSX) may correlate differently with U.S. or international markets.

---

### Role in Minimizing Emotional Decision-Making

One of the great strengths of any well-designed strategic asset allocation is the discipline it enforces:

1. **Avoiding Panic Sales or Overenthusiastic Buys:**  
   - With a clear long-term policy in place, investors are reminded to stay the course during periods of extreme market volatility. This helps prevent panic selling during downturns, such as during the 2020 COVID-19 market crash.  
   - It also reduces the tendency to chase “hot” sectors at market peaks, avoiding “buy highs” that can result in significant losses if a bubble bursts.

2. **Reducing Behavioral Biases:**  
   - Psychological factors such as herding, overconfidence, or recency bias can push investors away from rational, long-term strategies.  
   - A set SAA, reviewed periodically, fosters a systematic approach to rebalancing and ensures that decisions are made based on strategic guidelines rather than market sentiment alone.

3. **Case Example:**  
   - Assume an investor with a 70/30 equity/fixed income SAA faced the 2008 financial crisis. Had they deviated from their strategic plan and sold equities at the bottom, the potential to participate in the subsequent recovery would have been lost. Sticking to the policy portfolio, instead, allowed them to benefit from the market rebound.

---

### Periodic Review and Monitoring

Although strategic asset allocation focuses on stability, regular check-ups and adjustments are essential:

1. **Review Frequency:**  
   - Many advisors recommend an annual in-depth review.  
   - For Canadian institutional portfolios, reviews may occur quarterly, but major changes in policy are typically infrequent.

2. **Triggers for Adjustment:**  
   - Changes in an investor’s personal situation: job loss, divorce, inheritance, or approaching retirement.  
   - Significant shifts in capital market assumptions, such as a long-term change in the global interest rate environment or fundamental economic changes (e.g., permanent deglobalization reducing international equity returns).

3. **Review Process & Documentation:**  
   - Advisors in Canada must document recommendations and ensure they comply with the guidelines set forth by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and other applicable regulations.  
   - Transparent justification for any strategic shifts is crucial, especially if there are compliance audits or legal inquiries into an advisor’s recommendations.

```

1. **Client Goals & Constraints:**  
   - Establish return targets, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance.

2. **Risk Tolerance Assessment:**  
   - Conduct questionnaires and personal interviews to gauge comfort with volatility.

3. **Create Policy Portfolio:**  
   - Choose asset classes (e.g., Canadian equities, foreign equities, fixed income) and set weightings based on long-term capital market assumptions.

4. **Implement Investment Strategy:**  
   - Select specific securities, funds, or ETFs (e.g., RBC or TD mutual funds, CPPIB for institutions) to fill each asset class allocation.

5. **Monitor & Periodically Rebalance:**  
   - Realign asset classes back to target weights when significant deviations occur.

6. **Review & Adjust if Necessary:**  
   - Revise the policy portfolio to reflect major life changes or shifts in market assumptions.

### Glossary of Key Terms

- **Policy Portfolio:** The baseline mix of asset classes (e.g., 60% equities, 40% fixed income) deemed appropriate for meeting specific long-term objectives and constraints.  
- **Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions:** Forward-looking estimates of expected returns, volatilities, and correlations for different asset classes. Large asset managers often update these assumptions annually or quarterly.  
- **Volatility:** A statistical measure, frequently standard deviation, that captures the amount of variation or dispersion around the mean return of an asset or portfolio.

---

### Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Documentation:**  
   - Keep transparent records showing how the chosen SAA aligns with the client’s objectives and risk profile. This is crucial if questioned by regulators like CIRO.  

2. **Global Diversification:**  
   - Canadian markets are commodity-heavy, so diversifying into U.S. and global equities can reduce the concentration risk.  

3. **Alternative Assets:**  
   - Many Canadian pension funds (e.g., Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan) have successfully integrated alternatives like real estate, infrastructure, and private equity into their SAA. For individual investors, diversifying outside public markets may require additional due diligence and suitable investment vehicles (e.g., REITs, private funds).  

4. **Tax Efficiency:**  
   - Within Canada, certain tax-advantaged accounts, such as RRSPs and TFSAs, can hold different asset classes in line with SAA strategies. The selection of which asset classes go into which account type can have significant implications for after-tax returns.  

5. **Robust Governance Structure:**  
   - Implementing a formal Investment Policy Statement (IPS) helps ensure consistent SAA decisions, clarifies roles, and sets criteria for monitoring and reviewing the allocation.
