## 22.1 Bond Market Pricing

Bond market pricing is pivotal to wealth management strategies, particularly for advisors seeking to optimize client portfolios. Understanding how bonds are priced—and the various factors that can influence their value—enables financial professionals to offer tailored advice, comply with regulatory requirements, and help clients meet their wealth-building goals within the Canadian market. This section explores the core concepts of bond market pricing, discussing real-world examples, Canadian regulatory frameworks, and practical applications to ensure a well-rounded comprehension.

### Bonds as Debt Instruments

At its simplest, a bond is an IOU. An investor (the bondholder) effectively loans money to an issuer—such as a government, corporation, or other entity—for a set time (the bond’s term). In return, the issuer promises to:

• Pay interest (the coupon) at predetermined intervals (e.g., semi-annually).  
• Repay the face value (principal) at maturity.

Canadian government bonds often come in nominal increments of $1,000 or $5,000, whereas corporate bonds may vary, though $1,000 increments are still quite common. Key takeaways:

1. Bonds generate fixed (or semi-fixed) income streams that are particularly appealing to conservative or income-oriented investors.  
2. The issuer’s credit risk significantly influences the bond’s yield; higher perceived default risk typically translates into higher yield expectations.

---

### Price Quotations

Bond prices are conventionally quoted as a percentage of their face (par) value:

• For instance, a bond quoted at 98.50 means 98.50% of its par value. If the par value is $1,000, the bond’s quoted price is $985.00.  
• In Canada, Government of Canada bonds are often quoted in decimals (e.g., 99.25 = $992.50 per $1,000 face value).  

Knowing how to interpret these price quotations is critical for precisely valuing positions and understanding potential capital gains or losses when buying or selling bonds before maturity.

---

### Clean Price vs. Dirty Price

Two pricing conventions are widely used in bond markets:

1. **Clean Price:**  
   - Excludes accrued interest.  
   - Typically reported in financial media and price quotations.

2. **Dirty Price (Full Price):**  
   - Includes accrued interest from the last coupon payment date to (but not including) the settlement date.  
   - Represents the actual amount the buyer pays upon settlement.

When evaluating potential purchases or sales on behalf of a client, advisors should recognize that the transaction’s final cost will reflect the dirty price. While the clean price often appears in quotes, the dirty price is the true cash outflow (or inflow, if selling).

---

### Accrued Interest

Accrued interest represents the portion of interest the bond has earned since its most recent coupon payment. The buyer compensates the seller for this fraction of the upcoming coupon. The standard formula in Canada for accrued interest on a semi-annual coupon is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Accrued Interest} 
= \left( \frac{\text{Coupon Rate} \times \text{Face Value}}{\text{Number of Coupon Periods per Year}} \right) 
\times \frac{\text{Days Since Last Coupon}}{\text{Days in Coupon Period}}
{{< /katex >}}

• **Example:**  
  Suppose a corporate bond has a 6% annual coupon (paid semi-annually), $1,000 face value, and 183 days in each coupon period. If 61 days have passed since the last coupon date, the accrued interest would be calculated as follows:

  1. Semi-annual coupon = 6% / 2 = 3% of $1,000 = $30 per coupon.  
  2. Accrued interest = $30 × (61 / 183) = $10.00 approximately.

Whichever party is buying the bond needs to pay the seller $10 in accrued interest on top of the clean price. The dirty price would then be the clean price plus this accrued interest.

---

### Yield Measures

Bond yield can be expressed through several measurements. Each measure provides a slightly different perspective on the return:

1. **Coupon Rate:**  
   The annual interest rate, calculated on the bond’s face value. For a $1,000 face value bond with a 5% coupon, coupon payments total $50 per year.

2. **Current Yield:**  
   Current yield focuses on the bond’s market price. If the bond is trading at $900, its current yield is $50 ÷ $900 ≈ 5.56%.  

3. **Yield to Maturity (YTM):**  
   Arguably the most comprehensive yield measure, YTM accounts for:  
   - All coupon payments until maturity.  
   - The bond’s redemption value (par value) at maturity.  
   - The reinvestment of coupons at the same yield.  
   - Any capital gains or losses if you hold the bond until it matures.  

   YTM requires more complex calculations (often done with financial calculators or software tools such as QuantLib). YTM is especially important for financial planners, as it provides an annualized rate of return that captures all anticipated cash flows.  

4. **Yield to Call (YTC):**  
   Applicable if the bond has a call feature granting the issuer the right to redeem the bond before maturity. YTC helps assess the return if the issuer exercises the call. If interest rates drop significantly, issuers may call existing bonds to reissue debt at lower rates, thereby affecting an investor’s potential returns.

### Bond Pricing Formula (Present Value of Future Cash Flows)

The fundamental principle of bond pricing is **discounting future cash flows** (coupon payments and the redemption value) back to the present at an appropriate **discount rate**—often the prevailing yield or required rate of return for similar bonds.

The **generic formula** for a plain-vanilla coupon bond is:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Price} 
= \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\text{Coupon Payment}}{(1 + r)^n} 
+ \frac{\text{Redemption Value}}{(1 + r)^N}
{{< /katex >}}

where:  
• \\( r \\) is the required yield (discount rate) per coupon period (e.g., for semi-annual coupons, \\( r \\) is half the annual required yield if we assume simple division).  
• \\( n \\) is each coupon payment period from 1 to \\( N \\).  
• \\( N \\) is the total number of coupon payments to maturity.

#### Practical Example

Let’s consider a Government of Canada bond:

- Face Value = \$1,000  
- Annual Coupon = 6% (paid semi-annually at 3% each period)  
- 5 years until maturity (10 semi-annual periods)  
- Required Yield (semi-annually) = 2.5% per period (5% annual if simply divided)  

Using the above formula, you would discount each \$30 coupon payment for each of the 10 periods and add the discounted \$1,000 redemption at the final period. This calculation can be done quickly with a financial calculator or spreadsheet, employing the “Present Value of an Annuity + Present Value of a Lump Sum” framework:

1. PV of Annuity (coupons) = 30 × [1 − (1 + 0.025)^(-10)] / 0.025  
2. PV of Lump Sum (principal) = 1,000 × (1 + 0.025)^(-10)  

Add these two components to get the bond’s fair price.  

Below is a helpful visualization of the cash flow timeline and how discounting applies:

### Influencing Factors on Bond Pricing

Bond prices can fluctuate based on several variables:

1. **Interest Rates (Market Yields):**  
   The relationship between interest rates and bond prices is inverse: if rates go up, the present value of the bond’s fixed coupons decreases, causing bond prices to drop.

2. **Credit (Default) Risk:**  
   If a bond’s credit profile worsens, investors demand higher yields, forcing prices to decline. For instance, a downgrade by a rating agency for a corporate issuer generally leads to lower bond prices.

3. **Term to Maturity:**  
   Typically, longer-term bonds exhibit greater interest rate sensitivity. This is due to the extended duration over which coupon payments are exposed to fluctuating market rates.

4. **Market Liquidity:**  
   Highly liquid bonds, such as those issued by the federal government, often trade at tighter spreads and thus can maintain more stable pricing. Less liquid, thinly traded corporate bonds might see sharper price moves.

5. **Special Provisions (Callable, Putable, Convertible):**  
   - A **callable** bond may be redeemed by the issuer before maturity—often if interest rates fall.  
   - A **putable** bond allows the holder to sell (or “put”) the bond back to the issuer under certain conditions.  
   - A **convertible** bond lets the holder convert the bond into a predetermined number of the issuer’s shares.

Each of these features can significantly alter the bond’s risk-return profile, and hence its pricing.

### Practical Considerations for Advisors

Financial planners evaluating bonds for client portfolios should weigh multiple aspects:

• **Discount, Par, and Premium Bonds:**  
  - **Discount bond**: Market price < face value.  
  - **Par bond**: Market price ≈ face value.  
  - **Premium bond**: Market price > face value.  

  Understanding why a bond trades at a discount (usually higher yields demanded by market) or premium (usually lower yields, or high coupon relative to current rates) is essential for matching client income needs and market expectations.

• **Impact of Accrued Interest:**  
  Always clarify to clients that the settlement amount includes accrued interest, which might surprise those thinking only in terms of the quoted (clean) price.

• **Comparing Yield to Maturity (YTM):**  
  Among bonds with similar credit risk, maturity, and other characteristics, YTM comparisons help highlight more attractive opportunities.

• **Client Objectives and Risk Profiles:**  
  - Retirees or those seeking stable income may favor shorter maturities or less volatile bonds.  
  - Higher-risk tolerance investors might use a barbell strategy (mix of short and long maturities) to manage interest rate risk.

---

### Glossary

• **Face Value (Par Value):** The amount repaid at maturity (commonly \$1,000 in Canada).  
• **Accrued Interest:** Interest earned since the last coupon that is owed to the holder if a bond is sold before the next coupon date.  
• **Clean Price:** The bond’s market price excluding accrued interest.  
• **Dirty Price (Full Price):** The actual transaction price, which is the clean price plus accrued interest.  
• **Yield to Maturity (YTM):** The internal rate of return on a bond if held to maturity, including all coupons and principal repayment.
