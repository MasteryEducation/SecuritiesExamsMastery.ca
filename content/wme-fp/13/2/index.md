## 13.2 Retirement Income Needs Analysis

Retirement income needs analysis is essential for helping clients determine the amount they need to save and how to organize withdrawals to maintain financial stability in their retirement years. Effective retirement planning addresses expenses, income sources, inflation, and a variety of personal and regulatory factors. In Canada, advisors must pay particular attention to mandatory expenses such as housing, discretionary outlays like travel, and the ever-growing cost of healthcare. This section explores how to collect detailed information from clients, integrate multiple potential retirement income streams, and use both manual calculations and digital tools to stress-test financial plans.

---

## Gathering Client Information

A thorough, accurate retirement income needs analysis begins with collecting relevant data from clients. Financial planners should aim to move beyond basic form-filling for compliance and truly delve into each client’s lifestyle goals, family commitments, and potential health concerns.

### Mandatory Expenses

Mandatory expenses include costs deemed essential for a retiree’s daily life. Typical categories include:  
• Housing costs: Mortgage or rent, property taxes, condo fees, and maintenance.  
• Utilities: Electricity, natural gas, water, phone, and internet.  
• Property taxes: Specifically for homeowners; these vary between municipalities.  
• Insurance: House or condominium insurance, and possibly other forms of insurance (auto, health, etc.).

### Discretionary Expenses

Discretionary expenses focus on maintaining the retiree’s desired quality of life. Clients often want to spend more time traveling, indulging in hobbies, or socializing with family and friends once they retire. Examples include:  
• Travel and leisure: Costs of trips, vacation homes, and special events.  
• Hobbies: Golf club memberships, photography equipment, cooking classes, arts, and crafts.  
• Entertainment: Dining out, movies, and family gatherings.  
• Charitable giving or family gifts: Contributions to charities or family members.

### Healthcare Expenses

Healthcare costs can increase significantly as clients age. While universal healthcare in Canada covers basic medical needs, retirees often face additional expenses, such as:  
• Prescription medications.  
• Dental, vision care, or physiotherapy.  
• Long-term care insurance or private care if required.  
Advisors should prepare a conservative estimate for rising treatment and care costs, tailored to each client’s health profile and family history.

---

## Accounting for Inflation

Inflation is a vital factor in retirement planning, as it erodes purchasing power over time. By including a realistic (often conservative) inflation rate—potentially higher than the current rate—to forecast future expenses, planners can help ensure clients’ nest eggs remain sufficient.

### Why a Conservative Rate Matters

Using a slightly higher inflation assumption than the present rate provides an added margin of safety. In Canada, the Bank of Canada typically aims for an inflation target of around 2%. To be cautious, many planners may use 2.5% to 3% to stress-test the client’s expenses, especially for extended retirements that span 20 to 30 years.

### Inflation’s Impact on Different Expenses

Not all expenses increase at the same pace. Healthcare costs, for instance, tend to grow faster than general inflation. Including separate inflation rates for specific expense categories, such as prescription drugs or specialized medical care, can deliver a more refined analysis.

## Identifying and Projecting Income Sources

Most Canadians rely on multiple income streams during retirement, ranging from government pensions to personal investments. Each has distinct features and constraints.

### Government Pensions: CPP/QPP and OAS

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), along with Old Age Security (OAS), provide a foundational income. To accurately estimate these benefits:  
• Obtain and review the client’s “My Service Canada Account” or QPP statements to clarify potential CPP/QPP benefits.  
• Evaluate how deferring CPP/QPP until age 70 can result in increased monthly payouts.  
• Understand OAS eligibility requirements (e.g., residency) and how applying at different ages affects payment size.  
• Remain mindful of the OAS clawback threshold, particularly for high-income retirees.

### Employer-Sponsored Pension Plans

Clients with access to employer-sponsored pensions may belong to either a Defined Benefit (DB) or a Defined Contribution (DC) plan.

- **Defined Benefit (DB) Plan:** Offers a specified payout in retirement, typically based on average salary and years of service. This guaranteed source may reduce the volatility of retirement income needs.  
- **Defined Contribution (DC) Plan:** Contributions are invested, usually in mutual funds or other market instruments, so the final retirement income depends on accumulated returns. These plans require more active monitoring to keep the portfolio in line with the retiree’s risk tolerance.

### Personal Savings and Registered Plans

For many Canadians, personal savings and registered accounts create the largest segment of retirement income. These can include:  
• Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) contributions, rolled into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) once the client reaches 71.  
• Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), which offer flexibility in withdrawals and tax-free growth.  
• Non-registered investment accounts, which may offer different tax treatments for interest, dividends, and capital gains.  
• Rental property income or other passive income streams (e.g., royalties, limited partnerships).

### Coordinating with a Spouse or Partner

Spousal RRSPs, income-splitting strategies, and survivor benefits in pension plans can affect the overall retirement income picture. Building a retirement plan that integrates both spouses’ or partners’ resources can:  
• Help manage tax brackets through spousal RRSPs and pension income splitting.  
• Balance withdrawal strategies so that each partner’s savings are optimized.  
• Provide continuity of income in the event of the death of one spouse, ensuring that the surviving spouse can maintain their standard of living.

---

## Bridging Period Planning

Clients may choose to retire earlier than the standard age at which they become eligible for government or employer pensions. During this “bridging period,” they will rely mostly on personal savings, which might be in RRSPs, TFSAs, or other investment accounts.

### Timing: When Government Pensions Begin

- **CPP/QPP:** Clients can begin receiving reduced benefits as early as age 60 in exchange for lower monthly payments. Conversely, deferring beyond age 65 results in higher monthly benefits.  
- **OAS:** This often starts at age 65, but can be deferred for up to five years for a higher monthly payout.

### Investment Withdrawals Before Pensions Start

Advisors may recommend tapping into non-registered or Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) funds to minimize taxes during the bridging period. Targeting the correct mix of registered and non-registered assets can help:  
• Reduce taxable income by delaying RRSP withdrawals until the official pension begins.  
• Protect the principal in certain accounts if the market experiences volatility, providing flexibility in cash flow management.

## Tools and Methods for Forecasting

Financial planning software and scenario analysis are indispensable for modern retirement income planning. By running multiple models under different assumptions, clients can better grasp potential outcomes.

### Financial Planning Software

Many financial planning tools (e.g., NaviPlan, Snap Projections, PlanPlus) focus on:  
• Forecasting account balances, factoring in contribution rates and expected returns.  
• Stress-testing the retirement plan against market downturns, higher-than-expected inflation, or unexpected medical costs.  
• Presenting clear visuals, such as cash flow tables and net worth charts, which help clients see the interplay between age, withdrawal rates, and account depletion.  

### Stress-Testing Retirement Portfolios

Stress testing simulates adverse market events—like the 2008 financial crisis—and examines how a portfolio might perform. It helps advisors and clients:  
• Determine if the portfolio can withstand a significant decline in equities or rising interest rates.  
• Assess whether additional savings are needed or if spending should be reduced.  
• Revisit the potential of adding more conservative investments or insurance products (like annuities).

Below is a simplified Mermaid diagram illustrating a generic approach to retirement plan stress testing.

## Best Practices in Retirement Income Needs Analysis

1. **Regularly Update the Analysis:** A plan created at age 50 may not be as effective by age 55 or 60. Encourage annual or semi-annual reviews to track changes in the client’s situation and market conditions.  
2. **Overestimate Expenses:** Budget for contingencies such as unexpected home repairs, medical emergencies, or aiding adult children.  
3. **Plan for Longer Lifespans:** Given advancements in healthcare, consider the possibility of living into the late 80s or 90s.  
4. **Stay Informed of Tax Changes:** Canadian tax regulations evolve. Keep abreast of changes to RRSP contribution limits, TFSA contribution room, and required RRIF minimum withdrawals. Refer to the [Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html) for official updates.  
5. **Incorporate CIRO Guidelines:** The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) publishes resources and continuing education modules on suitable retirement product recommendations and compliance considerations.

## Canadian Case Study Illustration

### Scenario Overview

• Jane, age 62, plans to retire at 63. She has a substantial RRSP, some savings in a TFSA, and minimal non-registered investments.  
• Her spouse, Kyle, age 60, will continue working part-time until 65, at which point he’ll start drawing his Company DC pension.  

### Outline of Their Needs Analysis

1. **Expenses:** Their monthly housing costs are CAD 1,800. They anticipate travel expenses of about CAD 5,000 a year, plus CAD 2,000 for medical supplements.  
2. **Income Sources:** They plan to rely on Jane’s RRSP for the bridging period (age 63 to 65), until her OAS starts at age 65. For Kyle, partial income from his job covers daily expenses, and his DC pension comes into play at 65.  
3. **Inflation Assumption:** They used a 3% annual inflation rate for conservative estimates.  
4. **Simulation Results:** Their financial planner used RBC’s Retirement Planner and third-party software to run stress tests. Even with a 2008-style market crash scenario, the couple can maintain comfortable spending if portfolio withdrawals are capped at 4-4.5% annually.  
5. **Action Items:**  
   - Jane should consider deferring her CPP until 65 to increase monthly payments.  
   - The couple will top up Kyle’s TFSA during his working years to reduce future tax burdens.  
   - They set up an annual review schedule to update spending forecasts and portfolio allocations.

This case demonstrates how bridging periods, coordinated spousal strategies, and inflation assumptions collectively shape the retirement income plan.
