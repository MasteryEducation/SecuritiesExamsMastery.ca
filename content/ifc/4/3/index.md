## 4.3 What are the Steps in the Financial Planning Process?

Sometimes, when we talk about financial planning, it feels like there are a million complicated steps, each more daunting than the last. Well, let’s clear the air and break it down into something more friendly. Believe me, I still recall the first time I had to walk a friend through a comprehensive planning process—suddenly, I realized how important it was to keep it simple and structured. Below, we’ll split the whole thing into six clear stages. Each stage serves a distinct purpose, and if followed carefully, helps build a partnership with clients that is both trusting and productive for achieving their financial goals.

Before we dive in, it’s helpful to think about why we even have a “process.” The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) encourages advisors to follow a formalized framework to ensure that we’re always acting in the client’s best interest, consistently collecting the right data, and abiding by regulatory guidelines (like those found in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations). Having these steps in place also helps avoid confusion and ensures your client’s needs are front and center throughout the journey.

Below is a quick visual overview. Think of it as a road map that not only clearly marks each milestone but also highlights how each step leads naturally into the next:

```

As you can see, financial planning is iterative. After you monitor and review results, you often loop back to re-evaluating the relationship and goals. Let’s break down each step in more detail.

### Establishing the Client-Advisor Relationship

Kicking things off, the first step is to make sure both you and your client know what to expect. This is like meeting someone new for the first time and deciding how you’ll work together. Here’s where you:

• Clarify roles and responsibilities.  
• Outline the scope of your services (e.g., retirement planning, tax planning, or estate planning).  
• Provide transparent information about how you (as the advisor) get compensated.  
• Disclose any potential conflicts of interest or relationships that could influence advice.  

This is also a good time to talk about your regulatory obligations. Since we’re now under the umbrella of CIRO, your client should know that you operate under the latest compliance rules and guidelines. There might be some folks who recall hearing about the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) or the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), but remember: both of those organizations were amalgamated into CIRO as of January 1, 2023. In practical terms, that means your client can feel assured there’s a comprehensive self-regulatory organization working in their best interest, ensuring you follow the highest standards.

At this stage, I often share a personal anecdote about how I used to feel super anxious about explaining fees to clients—particularly if the fees were a bit more complex, like performance-based charges or trailing commissions. But I learned quickly that transparency built trust. Once the client understood exactly how advisors get paid, they felt comfortable asking questions about my approach and even more comfortable sharing personal details about their financial lives.

#### Key Best Practices
• Use plain language. Don’t say “basis points” if your client has never encountered that term.  
• Provide documents that outline regulatory disclosures required by CIRO.  
• Offer a service agreement (in plain English) that details what the client can expect going forward.

#### Possible Pitfalls
• Glossing over compensation structures. Clients might get uneasy if they suspect hidden fees.  
• Forgetting to highlight your fiduciary or best-interest duty.  
• Overloading the client with jargon that can deter them from being open about their real situation.

### Gathering Data and Identifying Goals

Next up is the data-gathering stage—where the rubber truly meets the road. This step is absolutely vital because your recommendations are only as good as the data you collect. You’ll look at:

• Personal information: age, family situation, job status, etc.  
• Financial details: income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and more.  
• Risk tolerance: how comfortable is the client with market fluctuations?  
• Time horizon: short-term vs. long-term goals (retiring early, buying a home, launching a new business).  
• Preferences and constraints: Are there any ethical investing concerns? Are there real estate limitations or small-business ownership complexities?  

It’s often a huge help here to remind clients that this is a team effort. You can’t craft a sound plan without accurate data. Also, you may want to request statements from banks, brokerage accounts, insurance policies, and real estate documentation. The more robust the documents, the more precise your projections.

#### Real-World Example
Imagine a client named Sarah, a 40-year-old single parent with two kids. She has a mortgage, some RRSP contributions, and a small stock portfolio. Her immediate goal is to save for her children’s post-secondary education and build a stronger retirement safety net. You quickly realize that to meet Sarah’s objectives, you need a comprehensive view of her debts, monthly budget, and the status of her children’s Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP).

#### Key Best Practices
• Use a standardized questionnaire or digital fact-finding tool so you don’t accidentally miss something.  
• Encourage clients to be honest—even if they’re embarrassed by, say, a large debt load or uncertain about tax liabilities.  
• If necessary, involve third-party professionals (like tax accountants) who can fill in critical details.

#### Possible Pitfalls
• Underestimating or overestimating the client’s risk tolerance, leading to inappropriate investment recommendations.  
• Missing liability details, which in turn might skew debt-to-asset ratios.  
• Failing to note changes in job status or health conditions that could severely impact financial plans.

### Analyzing and Evaluating the Data

Once you have a treasure trove of data, it’s time to sit down and analyze it. This is where you put on your detective hat and figure out what’s working, what’s not, and where the gaps might be in reaching the client’s stated goals.

Often, you’ll be calculating net worth (assets minus liabilities) and comparing it against the client’s short- and long-term objectives. You’ll also evaluate cash flow—maybe they need to reduce expenses if they want to meet an aggressive savings goal. Or maybe they’re underinsured if they have a young family. During this phase, you’re essentially saying, “Okay, we’ve got the puzzle pieces. Now, how do they all fit together—or do they fit at all?”

#### Quick Math Example (Net Worth)
Suppose Sarah has:
• Assets: Home equity of $250,000, RRSP worth $60,000, TFSA worth $15,000, and a small investment account of $25,000.  
• Liabilities: Mortgage of $200,000 and a personal line of credit for $10,000.  

Her net worth = Total Assets – Total Liabilities = ($250,000 + $60,000 + $15,000 + $25,000) – ($200,000 + $10,000) = $140,000.

It’s a simple calculation, but it’s a snapshot that gives you a clue about where she stands right now.

#### Analytical Tools
• Budgeting tools like open-source spreadsheets or software (e.g., GnuCash) to track income and expenses.  
• Asset allocation calculators to gauge if her portfolio’s mix is too conservative or too aggressive.  
• Regulatory guidelines, such as those from CIRO, to ensure the structure of the plan meets compliance standards.

#### Possible Pitfalls
• Not digging deep enough into the “why” behind certain expenses—like a large monthly bill for a family caretaker.  
• Using generic assumptions about investment returns or inflation without tailoring them to the client’s unique situation.  
• Failing to consider taxes, which can change net returns significantly.

### Developing Recommendations and Presenting the Plan

Now comes the part where you blend strategy and communication. Based on your analysis, you craft a plan that addresses the client’s goals, constraints, and preferences. The plan might include asset allocation strategies, insurance coverage, or retirement savings approaches. Keep in mind that each recommendation should tie back to the earlier data (that is, every piece of advice has a rationale).

#### Example Recommendations for Sarah
• Increase monthly contributions to her RRSP or TFSA to accelerate retirement savings.  
• Use a monthly budgeting app to identify cost-saving measures.  
• Adjust her existing RESP contributions to ensure her children’s education fund targets are on track.  
• Explore term life insurance to protect her kids in case something happens to her.

When you present these recommendations, clarity is paramount. It’s normal for a client to feel overwhelmed by financial jargon and assumptions about returns. If you can use plain language, analogies, or even short diagrams to show how the funds flow in and out, you’ll build way more confidence in your plan.

#### Regulatory Considerations under CIRO
Remember, any plan dealing with mutual funds, securities, or exchange-traded funds should comply with applicable know-your-client (KYC) and suitability rules. CIRO requires that you not just “sell,” but also ensure that your recommendations are genuinely aligned with the client’s best interest. If it ever appears your suggestions conflict with your client’s risk profile, you must be prepared to justify why you believe the product would still be suitable (or correct it if it’s not suitable).

#### Possible Pitfalls
• Presenting too many solutions without ranking or prioritizing them, leaving clients confused.  
• Overlooking the need for rebalancing down the road, especially if market swings cause the portfolio to drift away from ideal risk allocations.  
• Failing to highlight how each recommendation ties back to the client’s stated goals.

### Implementing the Plan

You’ve proposed your strategies—great. Now the rubber meets the road again. Implementation might involve opening or transferring investment accounts, purchasing insurance policies, or setting up an emergency fund. You might coordinate with other professionals, like a lawyer for estate planning or an accountant for tax-based solutions.

#### Implementation Tips
• Make sure the client understands the steps. For instance, if you’re setting up a Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD) for monthly RRSP contributions, outline how often the money will come out of their bank account.  
• Maintain clear records of every transaction, communication, and signed document. CIRO strongly encourages robust recordkeeping as a compliance best practice—and it’s just good business sense.  
• Follow up with any third parties. If your client’s mortgage specialist drags their feet on a renewal or doesn’t finalize a home equity line of credit, your plan might stall.

Plan implementation often feels like the “heaviest lifting” to your client because it means committing to real-life changes: spending less on luxuries or automatically saving more each month. You might notice a bit of hesitation. In such cases, personal anecdotes and success stories from other clients (or your own experiences) can show them that while it might be tough at first, the results are often well worth it.

### Monitoring and Reviewing

No plan survives unchanged after living in the real world for too long. Financial and personal circumstances can shift in a heartbeat. That’s why the final step is all about feedback loops.

Regular reviews—often quarterly or annually, or whenever a big life event happens—help you track progress and decide if adjustments are needed. For instance, a job loss, a market correction, or a new baby might require a dramatic pivot. In addition, regulatory or tax changes may spur updates. For example, your client might benefit from new government tax credits or from re-evaluating risk coverage in light of revised guidelines under Canadian law.

#### Example Review Points
• Portfolio Performance: Is the client’s investment portfolio still in line with their risk tolerance?  
• Life Changes: Have they moved, had a career shift, or had kids?  
• Market Conditions: Did we experience a recession or a boom that reshaped sector performance?  
• Regulatory Landscape: Any new rules from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) or CIRO that could change the compliance environment?

In my own practice, I once had a client whose circumstances changed drastically overnight. He inherited a large sum from a relative, which quickly moved him from a moderate to an ultra-conservative investor. While that sounds contradictory, his new wealth meant he could not afford to take any big losses, so we adjusted the entire portfolio, focusing on preserving his wealth rather than aggressively growing it.

#### Best Practices
• Keep a calendar for recurring check-ins.  
• Document updates thoroughly—CIRO compliance often requires a paper trail.  
• Encourage the client to keep you in the loop about major life events.

#### Possible Pitfalls
• Failing to meet with the client consistently, leading to out-of-date financial objectives.  
• Ignoring new product innovations or portfolio options that could better align with evolving goals.  
• Over-reliance on single-year performance metrics instead of holistic, long-term evaluations.

Sometimes, the hardest part about financial planning isn’t the technical spreadsheets or the complicated formulas—it’s having the courage to be transparent, empathetic, and client-focused at every turn. By thoroughly following the six-step planning process—establishing the relationship, gathering data, analyzing, developing a plan, implementing, and monitoring—you give clients a roadmap that adapts to life’s ups and downs. And as we Canadians know, life can change quickly. Whether it’s a new government policy or a personal milestone, a well-structured financial plan keeps you and your client on track.

Now that you have a better idea of the entire process, I hope you feel encouraged—even excited—to put it into practice. Treat it like a roadmap, and remember, the goal is to walk side-by-side with your client, guiding them toward a financially secure future.
