## 8.2 The Impacts of Economic Conditions in Comparing Returns

Have you ever wondered why your equity portfolio sometimes soars when the economy is humming along, but then your bond holdings seem to do better when there’s a slump? I remember back in 2008, I was so confused why my “safe” stock picks were tanking—even though I thought they were going to the moon. It was a humbling experience that showed me how tightly investment returns and economic conditions are interlinked.

In this section, we’ll explore how different aspects of the economy—like GDP growth, interest rates, and unemployment—can influence returns on various asset classes differently. We’ll also talk about the business cycle and why comparing returns across different periods must be done cautiously. Further, we’ll look at scenario analyses and stress tests to handle those “what if” situations that can really test your portfolio’s resilience. So, let’s dive in and see how economic conditions shape the returns you and your clients experience every day.

### Understanding the Business Cycle

The economy tends to run in cycles—often referred to as the business cycle. These cycles usually proceed through expansion, peak, contraction, and trough (with a recovery phase sometimes viewed as part of the trough-expansion transition). It’s in these stages that we see shifts in interest rates, credit availability, inflation, and consumer sentiment. Because these factors affect corporate earnings and bond yields, they also affect your portfolio’s returns.

A helpful way to visualize the business cycle is through a simple diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Expansion <br/> (Growing GDP)"] --> B["Peak <br/> (GDP Growth at Max)"]
    B["Peak <br/> (GDP Growth at Max)"] --> C["Contraction <br/> (Slowing Growth)"]
    C["Contraction <br/> (Slowing Growth)"] --> D["Trough <br/> (Lowest GDP Levels)"]
    D["Trough <br/> (Lowest GDP Levels)"] --> E["Recovery <br/> (GDP Begins to Rise)"]
    E["Recovery <br/> (GDP Begins to Rise)"] --> A["Expansion <br/> (Growing GDP)"]
```

∙ During expansions, companies often benefit from increased consumer spending, so stock prices can rise.  
∙ At the peak, growth has hit its maximum, and inflation may start to climb, so central banks might raise interest rates, which can affect bond prices.  
∙ When we move into contraction or recession, unemployment tends to rise, consumer spending goes down, and corporate profits suffer—often dragging down equity prices. However, government bonds might look more attractive in this environment.  
∙ Eventually, the cycle hits a trough, which is typically the bottom of the downturn. After that, you’ll often see a recovery, which renews investor confidence and pushes stock markets upward again.

### Equity vs. Bond Returns Across the Cycle

Some friends ask me why, in general, stocks do well during expansions, while bonds do better during downturns. Well, it’s mostly about growth projections and risk tolerance:

• Equities rely on strong corporate earnings. When the economy grows, unemployment is usually lower, consumers have more disposable income, companies make more money, and their stock prices trend upward.  
• Bonds, especially government bonds, are seen as “safer” than equities. When the economy contracts, investors often flock to them for stability. Additionally, central banks (like the Bank of Canada) may lower interest rates to stimulate growth, which typically raises the price of existing bonds.

Of course, this is a big-picture view. Within those broad trends, there are many nuances: not all equities respond to recessions the same way, and not all bonds gain equally during expansions or contractions. But understanding these typical patterns is a great starting point.

### Macroeconomic Indicators and Return Assessments

If you’ve skimmed any financial news site, you’ll have seen lots of headlines about GDP growth, unemployment rates, inflation, and interest rates. These are the macroeconomic indicators that get professionals excited—and sometimes stressed—because they have real impacts on investment performance.

• GDP Growth  
  - High GDP growth generally suggests a healthy economy, fueling optimism in equity markets.  
  - Persistently low or negative GDP growth can undermine consumer confidence and reduce corporate earnings, often resulting in lower equity returns.

• Unemployment Rates  
  - Low unemployment rates can boost consumer spending and corporate profitability, supporting stock prices.  
  - Rising unemployment typically signals economic slowdown. Investors often pivot to fixed-income or other safer assets.

• Inflation  
  - Inflation affects purchasing power. Nominal returns might look great, but if inflation is higher than your returns, you’re losing real purchasing power.  
  - High inflation often leads central banks to increase interest rates, affecting bond prices and equity valuations.

• Interest Rates  
  - Lower rates can stimulate borrowing and investing but also reduce bond yields.  
  - Higher rates can cool off economic expansion and suppress equity valuations but can make new bonds more attractive.

Because these factors swing over time, you can’t just compare returns from a strong expansion phase to returns from a contraction phase and conclude that one portfolio is superior. Always be aware of the macroeconomic context when making performance comparisons.

### Comparing Returns Over Similar Economic Phases

We all love a good chart that shows how our favorite portfolio has crushed the market over a certain period. But if that period straddles very different economic conditions—say, part of an expansion and then a tough contraction—you might be mixing apples with oranges.

Ensuring that returns are compared over similar business cycle phases helps you spot genuine skill in portfolio management, rather than simple luck. Essentially, you want to see how an investment performs:

• During expansions (when most risk assets typically do well)  
• During recessions (when defensively positioned or negatively correlated assets may outperform)  
• During inflection points, like when interest rates start rising or declining significantly

This consistency check helps you avoid misinterpretations. For instance, if one portfolio was tested only through a bull market, while another had to survive a recession, direct comparisons can be very misleading.

### Putting Returns in Real Terms: Nominal vs. Real

Investors often look at nominal returns—those straightforward percentages that show how much an asset has grown without adjusting for inflation. However, if inflation creeps in, the real returns might be lower. Imagine your nominal returns are 5%, but inflation is 3%. In reality, you’re only gaining 2% in purchasing power.

The formula for real return can be described (in simplified terms) as:

$$
\text{Real Return} = \text{Nominal Return} - \text{Inflation Rate}
$$

If you’re dealing with a country with modest inflation, you might be less panicked when you see a lower “real return” figure. But in periods of high inflation, that difference can become massive. A 10% nominal return in an environment clocking 8% inflation can feel a bit deflating—no pun intended.

### Currency Fluctuations and Global Returns

Let’s say you’re a Canadian investor holding U.S. stocks or an international mutual fund. Even if your foreign asset is up 10% in its local currency, a large upward swing in the Canadian dollar could reduce your returns when you convert back to Canadian dollars. In a global context, currency fluctuations play a major role:

• If the Canadian dollar appreciates vs. the U.S. dollar, your U.S.-based returns may translate into fewer Canadian dollars when you cash out.  
• Rapid changes in trade conditions—such as sudden tariffs or shifts in globalization trends—can also influence the performance of certain sectors.  

Part of the analysis includes looking at currency-hedged investments. Some ETFs or mutual funds hedge their foreign currency exposure against the Canadian dollar to lower the impact of exchange rate movements.

### Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing

One of my favorite strategies for helping clients (and myself) sleep better at night is scenario analysis and stress testing. Even though I can’t predict the next recession’s exact timing, or how severe an inflation spike might get, I can construct hypothetical situations to see how a portfolio might respond.

• Scenario Analysis:  
  This is where you model different “what if” situations—like a mild recession vs. a severe one—and see what happens to portfolio returns. You might consider scenarios such as:  
  - A sudden 2% rise in interest rates  
  - A dramatic slowdown in GDP growth  
  - An unexpected spike in inflation

• Stress Testing:  
  This goes a step further by deliberately modeling extreme or catastrophic events—think of the 2008 financial crisis or a sudden global shock. The idea is to push the portfolio’s assumptions to the limit to find hidden vulnerabilities.

These techniques are especially valuable in compliance contexts when registering with CIRO (the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization) because they demonstrate diligent planning and a robust, client-focused approach. They also provide a framework for discussing complex risk factors with clients in a more tangible way.

### Considering Canadian Regulatory Framework and Resources

As a reminder, CIRO is Canada’s current self-regulatory body overseeing investment dealers, mutual fund dealers, and marketplaces. If you’re advising clients in Canada, you’ll need to adhere to CIRO rules, disclosures, and best practices for performance reporting. You may recall from Chapter 3: The Canadian Regulatory Framework that regulators keep a close eye on how client returns are calculated and disclosed, ensuring fairness and transparency.

Moreover, all firms registered with CIRO must also provide investors protection through the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF). CIPF covers client account assets if a member firm becomes insolvent, which is especially important when the economy hits a downturn. While CIPF doesn’t protect investors from losses due to market movements, it does protect against insolvency or bankruptcy of the brokerage firm.

### Tools and Official Resources

• Bank of Canada – Economic Indicators:  
  Check out the Bank of Canada’s official website (https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/indicators) for interest rate announcements, GDP projections, and inflation data. Keeping on top of these numbers helps you interpret how investments may respond to shifting economic conditions.

• International Monetary Fund – World Economic Outlook:  
  The IMF publishes the World Economic Outlook (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo) with global forecasts and analyses. This can give you a broader perspective, especially if you hold international securities.  

• CIRO (https://www.ciro.ca):  
  CIRO routinely releases bulletins and guidelines on best practices for disclosures, return calculations, and compliance. They may also offer resources for comparing historical returns in ways that align with ethical requirements and transparent client reporting.

• “Economic Indicators for Dummies” by Michael Griffis:  
  It’s a wonderfully approachable primer on macroeconomic fundamentals if you’re looking for an easy-to-digest conversation about GDP, inflation, interest rates, and how they tie together.

### Best Practices, Common Pitfalls, and Strategies

• Stay Informed About the Business Cycle:  
  Regularly review updates from reliable sources—like the Bank of Canada or StatsCan documentation—to assess where we might stand in the cycle. This helps you anticipate shifts in equity or bond performance.

• Use Both Nominal and Real Returns in Reports:  
  This is a must-do to give clients a clearer picture of their purchasing power. Don’t let them (or yourself) be misled by higher nominal returns during high-inflation periods.

• Diversify Against Currency Risks:  
  Currency fluctuations are a big deal in global investing, so consider hedging strategies or at least educate clients about the potential ups and downs of holding foreign assets.

• Perform Scenario Analysis and Stress Tests:  
  By looking at different economic situations—both moderate and extreme—you can prepare realistic expectations and mitigate damage during a market shock.

• Avoid Straight-Line Projections:  
  One big trap is to assume the current environment will just keep going. Instead, consider the cyclical nature of economies and how no single phase lasts forever.

• Document Your Rationale:  
  Whatever strategies you choose, keep a paper trail. Regulators like CIRO want to see that you’ve done your homework when recommending or comparing portfolios, especially if you’re using historical performance as a selling point.

### Practical Example: Equities vs. Bonds in a Trough Scenario

Let’s do a quick example. Suppose we’re at a trough in the business cycle. Employment is low, consumer spending is muted, inflation is minimal, and the central bank has cut interest rates significantly. Historically:

• Equity markets might look cheap, but they can remain depressed if companies have immediate profitability challenges. However, a trough often signals a future turning point, so equities might have greater upside potential if purchased at this stage.  
• Bonds—particularly government issues—might become less attractive going forward if interest rates are expected to rise from their low point. Current holders of bonds have benefited from falling yields (hence rising bond prices), but future returns might be constrained.

This scenario can change dramatically depending on whether the economy bounces back strongly or lingers in a slow-growth environment. Scenario analysis would examine both a strong recovery (boosting equities significantly) and a more stagnant scenario (where you might still rely on the relative stability of fixed-income).

### Emotional Factors and the Human Element

Sometimes, I’ll catch myself thinking, “Well…I feel comfortable investing more aggressively now, the markets seem so calm.” But emotional factors can be misleading because expansions can create a false sense of security. Conversely, recessions can prompt panic selling even when it might be a fantastic time to buy. A balanced view, rooted in actual economic data and risk management, will often serve you better than gut feeling alone.

### Continuous Learning

Whether you’re a brand-new investor or a seasoned financial professional, keep learning. Economic conditions evolve, and new tools come out all the time to help measure and interpret these shifts. Engaging with the material in the rest of this chapter, as well as Chapter 6: Product Due Diligence, Recommendations, and Advice, can add an extra layer of insight as you align specific products with appropriate economic contexts.

### Conclusion

Comparing returns across different economic conditions is crucial for a fair assessment of how well a portfolio, strategy, or fund manager is truly performing. By understanding exactly where we are in the business cycle—and by knowing how interest rates, inflation, currency movements, and global conditions play a role—we can better calibrate our expectations. Real vs. nominal returns matter, too, especially if inflation is sneaking up on us. Finally, scenario analysis and stress testing help us peek around the corner, so we’re not caught off-guard by sudden, jarring economic shifts.

Feel free to return to this section whenever you need a quick refresher on how returns may vary under changing economic conditions. After all, the market rarely moves in a straight line—so it’s up to us to chart those shifts and make sense of them for ourselves and for our clients.

### In a recessionary environment, investors often shift toward government bonds. One reason is:

- [x] Bonds are generally viewed as less risky, offering more stability.
- [ ] Bond prices are never affected by interest rates.
- [ ] Equity prices always rise in a recession.
- [ ] Inflation is higher in a recession, which boosts bond returns.

> **Explanation:** Government bonds are seen as safer, especially during economic downturns when equity markets can become more volatile.

### Which of the following best describes scenario analysis?

- [x] A process of evaluating possible future events by considering different outcomes.
- [ ] A guaranteed prediction of economic conditions.
- [x] Modeling worst-case, base-case, and best-case environments.
