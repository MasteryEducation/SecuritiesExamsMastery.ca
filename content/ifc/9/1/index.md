## 9.1 What Are the Financial Statements?

Picture this: You’re sitting down with a client who is excited about purchasing shares in a Canadian technology company. They’ve read impressive news articles on this firm’s new product line, and everything seems great from a quick online search. But before you jump in and say, “Yeah, go ahead,” there’s a crucial step you can’t skip—examining the company’s financial statements. If you think about it, those statements are a bit like the “blueprints” of a company’s financial health. They reveal how well (or how poorly) the company manages its resources, where its money comes from, and how it’s spent.

Below, we’ll walk through the key financial statements generally prepared by Canadian companies, referencing accepted accounting principles that shape them, like International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises (ASPE). We’ll also look at the role of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and highlight the importance of SEDAR+ filings for public companies. By the end, you’ll see why mastering these reports is essential for guiding investment decisions, whether you’re a new mutual fund representative or a seasoned advisor. So, let’s jump right in.

### Why Financial Statements Matter
Well, you might be wondering: can’t I just rely on financial news blips and market chatter? Sure, those things provide some context. But at the end of the day, an objective look at the numbers can reveal opportunities to seize—or pitfalls to avoid. Financial statements are standardized documents used to convey a wealth of information. They aren’t merely optional reading: for any public company in Canada, they’re mandatory and must be filed regularly with CSA via SEDAR+ (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval).

In the grand scheme of investing, understanding financial statements:
• Clarifies a company’s solvency—can it handle its long-term debts?  
• Reveals liquidity—how quickly can it turn assets into usable cash?  
• Highlights profitability—are there strong earnings, or is the business just scraping by?  
• Exposes changes in equity—who “owns” what portion of the company at this point?  
• Uncovers cash flow patterns—how is money really moving into and out of operations?  

Armed with these insights, you (and your clients) can make evidence-based decisions aligned with broader investment goals.

### Accepted Accounting Frameworks: IFRS and ASPE
In Canada, companies typically stick to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) if they’re publicly held or large in scale. Meanwhile, smaller private enterprises often follow ASPE (Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises). Both sets of standards aim to present transparent and comparable financial data, though IFRS is far more detailed and internationally recognized. 

Below is a simplified comparison table:

| Aspect                               | IFRS                                                                | ASPE                                                              |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope                                | Used by publicly accountable enterprises (public companies)         | Used by private Canadian businesses                               |
| Level of Detail                      | Extensive disclosure requirements                                   | Fewer disclosure requirements                                     |
| International Alignment              | Consistent with global standards                                    | Primarily Canadian-focused                                        |
| Updating Body                         | Issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)       | Issued by the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) in Canada         |
| Regulatory Oversight                 | Must comply with CSA for public filings on SEDAR+                   | Limited oversight unless the private company moves to go public   |

Whichever framework applies, the ultimate goal is to present a fair, consistent, and transparent snapshot of a company’s financial standing.

### Mandatory Public Filings and SEDAR+
Publicly traded Canadian companies are required to submit their financial statements to SEDAR+ to comply with the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). SEDAR+ is essentially a platform that ensures anyone—investors, analysts, or the general public—can easily find official financial documents. This level of transparency allows you to perform your own due diligence, verify the facts behind the headlines, and compare different firms within the same sector.

If you or your client is considering an investment in a publicly listed corporation, your first stop should be a quick search on SEDAR+ (https://www.sedarplus.ca/). There you’ll find annual and quarterly statements, along with materials such as Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), which can be incredibly insightful.

### The Core Financial Statements
Typically, when we talk about “financial statements,” we mean the following key documents:

• Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)  
• Statement of Comprehensive Income (Income Statement)  
• Statement of Changes in Equity  
• Statement of Cash Flows  
• Notes to the Financial Statements  

These five statements (or sets of schedules, technically) work together to form a cohesive picture of a company’s performance. For a mutual fund, these statements often include additional details on portfolio holdings, potential risks, and performance metrics, which are further discussed in a Management Report of Fund Performance (MRFP).

Below is a visual representation of how these statements connect with one another, using a simple flowchart:

```

As you can see, each statement relates to the others in some way. Think of it like a puzzle: all the pieces are necessary to see the full financial picture.

#### Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)
The Statement of Financial Position provides a snapshot—usually as of a specific date—of what the company owns (assets), owes (liabilities), and the leftover interest for shareholders (equity). This statement answers questions about solvency: can the business handle longer-term obligations? It also sets the stage for analyzing liquidity. For instance, a large pile of cash on the balance sheet indicates capacity for investments or expansions, whereas a heavy load of current liabilities might raise concerns about short-term obligations.

An example of a typical (simplified) Balance Sheet might look like this:

|                                   | Amount (CAD)    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Assets                            |                 |
| Cash and Cash Equivalents         | $100,000        |
| Accounts Receivable               | $50,000         |
| Inventory                         | $25,000         |
| Property, Plant, and Equipment    | $200,000        |
| TOTAL ASSETS                      | $375,000        |
| Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity |               |
| Accounts Payable                  | $30,000         |
| Long-Term Debt                    | $120,000        |
| TOTAL LIABILITIES                 | $150,000        |
| Share Capital                     | $100,000        |
| Retained Earnings                 | $125,000        |
| TOTAL EQUITY                      | $225,000        |
| TOTAL LIABILITIES & EQUITY        | $375,000        |

Seeing such a snapshot, you immediately understand if the company’s assets exceed its liabilities and how much shareholder equity is in the mix.

#### Statement of Comprehensive Income (Income Statement)
Sometimes called the “Profit & Loss Statement,” the Statement of Comprehensive Income shows revenues, expenses, and resulting profits (or losses) for a specific period. This is the scoreboard that tells you how the company performed in terms of generating earnings. If the company spent more than it earned, you’ll see a net loss. If the revenue side is consistently strong while costs are well-managed, you’ll see (hopefully) a healthy profit.

Many advisors zero in on metrics like “net income” or “earnings per share” here. But it’s also crucial to study the breakdown of revenues and expenses. For instance, a sudden spike in administrative costs might prompt an important question: “Are these new expenses a sign of expansion, or uncontrolled overhead?”

#### Statement of Changes in Equity
Equity is essentially what’s left if you subtract total liabilities from total assets. This statement details movements in the equity accounts over a given period. For example, if the company issues new shares to raise capital, or if there’s a dividend declared that reduces retained earnings, you’ll see it here. 

Often overshadowed by the flashier Income Statement, the Statement of Changes in Equity is essential for tracking how shareholders’ interests evolve. For mutual fund clients, changes in equity highlight how the fund’s net asset value (NAV) might move over time—either benefiting or hurting them as unit holders.

#### Statement of Cash Flows
You might have heard the phrase, “Cash is king.” And yes, I admit, it sounds cliché, but it’s true. The Statement of Cash Flows focuses on how much cash was generated or used by the company’s operating, investing, and financing activities over a certain span. A business could be profitable on paper (according to net income) but still see negative cash flow if, for example, it invests heavily in new machinery or expands inventory. Conversely, a company might be profitable from an operational standpoint, but if it’s pulling in quick loans to make up shortfalls in daily expenses, that’s a red flag you’ll see in the financing section.

Understanding cash flow is vital because it answers “Where is the money coming from, and where is it going?” and not just “Did we make a profit?” If you have a firm that constantly struggles to generate positive operating cash flows, it may not be sustainable in the long run.

#### Notes to the Financial Statements
The final piece of the puzzle is the Notes section. Here, the company provides additional context and breakouts of the numbers in the four main statements. Suppose you spot a large intangible asset on the Balance Sheet. You might need an explanation—maybe it’s goodwill from an acquisition, or maybe it’s the brand value from earlier expansions. The Notes section will clarify how that intangible asset is measured or tested for impairment. 

As a mutual fund representative or investment advisor, the Notes can offer critical clues about upcoming capital expenditures, pending lawsuits (contingent liabilities), or the nature of certain transactions that significantly affect the bottom line.

### Financial Statements for Mutual Funds
Mutual funds also produce financial statements that follow standard accounting principles, but these often come with added commentary on holdings, portfolio turnover, and sector allocations. This extra detail helps advisors and investors alike figure out how the fund’s strategy and market exposure support short- and long-term objectives. The Management Report of Fund Performance (MRFP), which accompanies the financial statements, discusses performance and risk from the manager’s perspective. So, if you need to reassure your clients about why certain stocks are in the fund’s top 10 holdings, you’ll likely find the rationale here.

### Communicating Findings to Clients
Financial statements can be intimidating for newcomers, so it’s key to break them down into bite-sized chunks for your clients:
• Translate jargon into everyday language: Instead of “liquidity,” say “How easy is it for them to cover bills?”  
• Use analogies: If a company’s Income Statement is strong but the Cash Flow Statement is weak, it’s like paying bills with a credit card—great for short-term illusions of wealth, but possibly risky down the road.  
• Highlight big wins and big risks: This fosters transparency and trust.  

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
From personal experience, I’ve sometimes glossed over footnotes only to miss significant details about upcoming legal settlements or contractual obligations. Don’t make that mistake. Always read the footnotes. Another pitfall is focusing solely on net earnings, ignoring how the company arrived at those earnings. Maybe you see big one-time gains from selling off a building, inflating net income for one quarter. That’s not necessarily sustainable growth.

It’s also important to track year-over-year trends, not just a single period. A one-time spike in profits might mask a deeper issue, like a drop in sales volume that only gets covered up by currency fluctuations or short-term cost cuts.

### Staying Within the Canadian Regulatory Framework
• Follow documents issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) for official requirements on financial disclosures.  
• If you’re dealing with a public company, confirm all mandatory statements and disclosures were indeed filed on SEDAR+.  
• Keep abreast of any changes in IFRS or ASPE by monitoring announcements from the IFRS Foundation (for IFRS) or CPA Canada Handbook (for ASPE).  

Although historically there were different self-regulatory organizations like IIROC and the MFDA, these have amalgamated into the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO). CIRO continues to maintain professional standards and investor protection across different dealer channels.

### Summing It All Up
Financial statements provide the bricks and mortar for a full understanding of a company’s or fund’s financial health. It might feel a bit daunting at first—especially if you’re looking at page after page of data—but once you know the basics of each statement, you’ll see how they fit together to reveal a coherent narrative. If your client says, “I’m really excited about this sector,” you’ll be able to respond with something more robust than mere speculation. You’ll be able to say, “Let’s look at the fundamentals.”

Remember, the Statement of Financial Position outlines solvency and liquidity, the Statement of Comprehensive Income reveals profitability, the Statement of Changes in Equity shows how owners’ stakes shift, the Statement of Cash Flows highlights real cash generation and usage, and the Notes tie everything together with deeper explanations. Master these, and you’ll empower investors to make informed decisions.
