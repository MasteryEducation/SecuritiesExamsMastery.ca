## 20.1 Introduction to Alternative Investments

Alternative investments have long been a cornerstone for high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors seeking diversification and enhanced returns. Historically, hedge funds have been at the forefront of this investment category, offering sophisticated strategies that aim to generate alpha, mitigate risk, and provide uncorrelated returns relative to traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds.

### Historical Popularity of Hedge Funds

Hedge funds emerged in the mid-20th century as a vehicle for wealthy investors to pursue absolute returns, regardless of market conditions. These funds employ a wide array of strategies, including long/short equity, global macro, and event-driven approaches, allowing them to capitalize on market inefficiencies. The allure of hedge funds lies in their flexibility and the expertise of their managers, who often employ leverage and derivatives to enhance returns.

For decades, hedge funds were predominantly accessible to institutional investors—such as pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies—and high-net-worth individuals. These investors were drawn to hedge funds for their potential to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns and their ability to hedge against market downturns.

### Limited Access for Retail Investors

Despite their popularity among institutional and affluent investors, hedge funds remained largely out of reach for retail investors. This was due to regulatory restrictions, high minimum investment thresholds, and the complex nature of hedge fund strategies, which often required sophisticated investor knowledge and risk tolerance.

Retail investors, defined as individuals who buy and sell securities for their personal accounts, faced significant barriers to entry in the hedge fund space. These barriers were put in place to protect less experienced investors from the high risks and potential volatility associated with hedge fund investments.

### Introduction of Alternative Mutual Funds

The landscape of alternative investments began to shift in Canada following regulatory changes in October 2018. These changes, encapsulated in [National Instrument 81-102](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40642.pdf), allowed for the creation of alternative mutual funds. These funds are designed to provide retail investors with access to alternative investment strategies that were previously exclusive to hedge funds.

Alternative mutual funds, sometimes referred to as "liquid alts," offer a more accessible entry point for retail investors. They are structured similarly to traditional mutual funds but have the flexibility to employ alternative strategies, such as short selling, leverage, and derivatives, within a regulated framework. This innovation has democratized access to sophisticated investment strategies, enabling retail investors to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional asset classes.

### Assets Under Management in Alternative Strategy Funds

The introduction of alternative mutual funds has significantly expanded the alternative investment universe. These funds now hold a substantial portion of assets under management (AUM) within the alternative investment sector. This growth reflects the increasing demand from retail investors for diversified investment options that can enhance portfolio performance and reduce correlation with traditional markets.

Canadian financial institutions, such as RBC and TD, have been at the forefront of offering alternative mutual funds, leveraging their expertise in asset management to cater to the evolving needs of investors. These funds have become an integral part of the investment landscape, providing both retail and institutional investors with tools to achieve their financial goals.
