## 20.17 Accredited Investor Exemption

In the realm of Canadian securities, the Accredited Investor Exemption plays a pivotal role in facilitating investment opportunities for both institutional and individual investors. This exemption allows qualified investors to participate in private capital markets without the need for a prospectus, thereby providing access to a broader range of investment opportunities. Understanding the criteria and compliance requirements for this exemption is crucial for financial professionals and investors alike.

### Understanding the Accredited Investor Criteria

The Accredited Investor Exemption is defined under [National Instrument 45-106](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40645.pdf), which outlines the specific criteria that investors must meet to qualify as accredited. These criteria are designed to ensure that only those with sufficient financial acumen and resources can participate in higher-risk investment opportunities.

#### Institutional Accredited Investors

Institutional investors are typically large entities with significant financial resources. The criteria for institutional accredited investors include:

- **Pension Funds:** These are large pools of capital managed on behalf of employees, often with net assets exceeding $5 million.
- **Trust Companies:** Financial institutions that act as trustees for individuals or organizations, managing assets and investments.
- **Corporations:** Companies with net assets of at least $5 million, allowing them to invest in exempt securities.

These entities are presumed to have the necessary expertise and resources to assess and manage the risks associated with alternative investments.

#### Individual Accredited Investors

Individual investors can also qualify as accredited investors if they meet certain financial thresholds. The criteria for individual accredited investors include:

- **Financial Assets:** Individuals must own financial assets exceeding $1 million, excluding their primary residence. This ensures they have sufficient liquidity to absorb potential losses.
- **Net Income:** Individuals must have a net income exceeding $200,000 annually, or $300,000 when combined with a spouse, for the past two years. This demonstrates a consistent level of financial stability.
- **Net Assets:** Individuals must have net assets of at least $5 million, providing a substantial financial cushion.

These criteria are designed to ensure that individual investors have the financial capacity to withstand the risks associated with exempt securities.

### Risk Acknowledgment and Compliance

Accredited investors are required to complete a **Risk Acknowledgment Form**, a crucial document where they confirm their understanding of the risks involved in investing in exempt securities. This form serves as a safeguard, ensuring that investors are fully aware of the potential for loss and the lack of regulatory oversight in these investments.

#### Glossary

- **Risk Acknowledgment Form:** A document where accredited investors confirm their understanding of the risks associated with investments in exempt securities.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of the Accredited Investor Exemption, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Canadian Pension Fund

A Canadian pension fund with net assets of $10 million decides to invest in a private equity fund. As an institutional accredited investor, the pension fund qualifies for the exemption, allowing it to bypass the prospectus requirement and invest directly in the fund. This enables the pension fund to diversify its portfolio and potentially achieve higher returns.

#### Example 2: High-Net-Worth Individual

An individual with $1.5 million in financial assets and an annual income of $250,000 is interested in investing in a hedge fund. By meeting the criteria for individual accredited investors, this person can invest in the hedge fund without the need for a prospectus, gaining access to sophisticated investment strategies that are typically unavailable to the general public.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

While the Accredited Investor Exemption offers significant opportunities, it also comes with inherent risks. Here are some best practices and common pitfalls to consider:

#### Best Practices

- **Thorough Due Diligence:** Accredited investors should conduct comprehensive research and analysis before investing in exempt securities. This includes understanding the investment strategy, management team, and potential risks.
- **Diversification:** To mitigate risk, investors should diversify their portfolios across different asset classes and investment vehicles.
- **Professional Advice:** Seeking advice from financial advisors or legal professionals can provide valuable insights and help navigate complex investment decisions.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Overconfidence:** Accredited investors may overestimate their ability to assess and manage risk, leading to poor investment decisions.
- **Lack of Liquidity:** Exempt securities often lack liquidity, making it difficult to sell or exit investments quickly.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Investors must stay informed about changes in regulations that could impact their investment strategies.

### Regulatory Framework and Additional Resources

For those seeking to deepen their understanding of the Accredited Investor Exemption, the following resources are invaluable:

- **Regulations:** [National Instrument 45-106](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40645.pdf) provides detailed information on the criteria and requirements for accredited investors in Canada.
