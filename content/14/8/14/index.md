## 20.13 Alternative Investment Structures

In the ever-evolving landscape of finance, alternative investments have emerged as a pivotal component of diversified portfolios. These investments often employ complex strategies and are housed within various structures, each with unique characteristics and regulatory requirements. This section delves into the different structures that support alternative investment strategies, focusing on hedge funds, alternative mutual funds, funds of hedge funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We will explore how these structures differ, their regulatory environments, and their roles within the Canadian financial market.

### Overview of Alternative Investment Structures

Alternative investment structures are designed to accommodate strategies that differ from traditional investments like stocks and bonds. These structures provide flexibility in terms of investment strategies, risk management, and potential returns. The primary structures include:

1. **Hedge Funds**: These are private investment funds that employ a range of strategies to earn active returns for their investors. They can invest in a variety of assets and use techniques such as leverage, derivatives, and short selling.

2. **Alternative Mutual Funds**: Also known as liquid alts, these funds offer retail investors access to hedge fund-like strategies with the liquidity of mutual funds. They are subject to specific regulatory requirements that ensure investor protection.

3. **Funds of Hedge Funds**: These are investment funds that allocate capital to a selection of hedge funds. They provide diversification across different hedge fund strategies and managers.

4. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, similar to stocks. They hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and often track an index.

### Comparison of Investment Structures

#### Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are typically structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. They are known for their flexibility in investment strategies, which can include long/short equity, market neutral, arbitrage, and global macro strategies. Hedge funds are generally accessible only to accredited investors due to their higher risk profiles and less stringent regulatory oversight compared to mutual funds.

**Pros**:
- High potential returns through diverse strategies.
- Flexibility in investment choices and risk management.

**Cons**:
- High fees, including management and performance fees.
- Limited liquidity, with lock-up periods and redemption restrictions.

#### Alternative Mutual Funds

Alternative mutual funds, or liquid alts, are mutual funds that incorporate alternative strategies. They are regulated under [National Instrument 81-102](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40642.pdf), which governs mutual funds in Canada. This regulation ensures transparency, liquidity, and investor protection.

**Pros**:
- Access to alternative strategies with daily liquidity.
- Lower minimum investment requirements compared to hedge funds.

**Cons**:
- Potentially lower returns due to regulatory constraints.
- Management fees can still be higher than traditional mutual funds.

#### Funds of Hedge Funds

Funds of hedge funds invest in a portfolio of hedge funds, offering diversification across different strategies and managers. This structure mitigates the risk associated with investing in a single hedge fund.

**Pros**:
- Diversification across multiple hedge funds.
- Professional management and due diligence.

**Cons**:
- Additional layer of fees on top of underlying hedge fund fees.
- Potential for lower returns due to fee structure.

#### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are popular for their liquidity, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. They can track a wide range of indices, sectors, or strategies, including alternative investments.

**Pros**:
- Traded on exchanges, offering high liquidity.
- Lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds.

**Cons**:
- Limited ability to employ complex strategies compared to hedge funds.
- Tracking error risk if the ETF does not perfectly replicate its benchmark.

### Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape for alternative investment structures varies significantly. In Canada, hedge funds are less regulated than mutual funds, allowing them greater flexibility but also posing higher risks. Alternative mutual funds are subject to [National Instrument 81-102](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40642.pdf), which imposes restrictions on leverage, short selling, and derivatives usage to protect retail investors.

ETFs, while offering transparency and liquidity, must comply with regulations that ensure they accurately track their benchmarks and provide adequate disclosure to investors. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) oversee these regulations, ensuring that all investment structures operate within a framework that balances innovation with investor protection.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), often utilize alternative investment structures to enhance returns and diversify risk. For instance, CPPIB invests in hedge funds and alternative mutual funds to gain exposure to non-traditional asset classes and strategies.

#### Major Canadian Banks

Banks like RBC and TD offer alternative mutual funds to their clients, providing access to sophisticated investment strategies within a regulated framework. These funds allow retail investors to benefit from hedge fund-like strategies without the high minimum investments and fees associated with traditional hedge funds.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

**Best Practices**:
- Diversify across different alternative investment structures to mitigate risk.
- Conduct thorough due diligence on fund managers and strategies.
- Stay informed about regulatory changes that may impact investment structures.

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Overlooking fees and expenses that can erode returns.
- Failing to understand the liquidity constraints of certain structures.
- Ignoring the impact of regulatory changes on investment strategies.

### Conclusion

Alternative investment structures offer a wide array of opportunities for investors seeking diversification and enhanced returns. Understanding the nuances of each structure, from hedge funds to ETFs, is crucial for making informed investment decisions. By considering the regulatory environment, potential risks, and practical applications, investors can effectively incorporate alternative investments into their portfolios.
