## 20.12 Alternative Strategy Risk Drivers

Alternative investment strategies, such as hedge funds, private equity, and real estate, offer unique opportunities for diversification and potential high returns. However, they also come with a distinct set of risks that investors must understand to effectively manage their portfolios. In this section, we will explore the various risk drivers associated with alternative strategy funds, classify these risks, and discuss their impact on the overall performance and stability of these investments.

### Classification of Risks

Understanding the classification of risks is crucial for managing alternative investments. We can categorize these risks into three main types: First-Order Risks, Second-Order Risks, and Operational Risks.

#### First-Order Risks

First-order risks, also known as systematic risks, are related to the overall market direction. These risks are inherent to the entire market and cannot be eliminated through diversification. They include:

- **Market Risk:** The risk of losses due to changes in market prices. For example, a decline in the stock market can affect the value of equity-based alternative investments.
- **Interest Rate Risk:** The risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of investments, particularly those involving fixed income or leveraged strategies.

#### Second-Order Risks

Second-order risks are more specific to the characteristics of alternative investments. They include:

- **Liquidity Risk:** The risk that an investment cannot be sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss. Alternative investments often have longer lock-up periods, making them less liquid.
- **Leverage Risk:** The risk associated with using borrowed funds to increase investment exposure. While leverage can amplify returns, it also increases the potential for significant losses.
- **Deal Breakage Risk:** The risk that a planned transaction or investment will not be completed, which can lead to financial losses.
- **Default Risk:** The risk that a borrower will not be able to make required payments on their debt obligations.
- **Counterparty Risk:** The risk that the other party in a financial transaction may default on their obligations. This is particularly relevant in derivatives and over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.
- **Trading Risk:** The risk associated with the execution of trades, including timing and pricing issues.
- **Concentration Risk:** The risk of loss due to a large exposure to a single asset or group of assets.
- **Pricing Model Risk:** The risk that the models used to price certain securities or derivatives are incorrect, leading to mispricing and potential losses.
- **Trading Model Risk:** The risk associated with the failure of trading strategies or models to perform as expected.

#### Operational Risk

Operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems. This includes:

- **System Failures:** Breakdowns in technology or infrastructure that can disrupt trading or operations.
- **Faulty Procedures:** Inefficient or incorrect processes that can lead to errors or financial losses.
- **Human Error:** Mistakes made by employees that can impact the performance of the fund.

### Impact of Risks on Performance and Stability

The risks associated with alternative strategy funds can significantly impact their performance and stability. Understanding these risks allows investors to make informed decisions and implement effective risk management strategies.

- **Performance Volatility:** High levels of leverage and concentration can lead to increased volatility in returns. Investors must be prepared for potential fluctuations in performance.
- **Liquidity Constraints:** Limited liquidity can restrict an investor's ability to access their capital, particularly during market downturns.
- **Operational Failures:** Ineffective operational processes can lead to significant financial losses and damage to the fund's reputation.

### Managing Risks in Alternative Investments

To manage these risks, investors should:

- **Diversify Investments:** Spread investments across different asset classes and strategies to reduce exposure to any single risk.
- **Conduct Due Diligence:** Thoroughly evaluate the fund's management team, investment strategy, and risk management processes.
- **Monitor Performance:** Regularly review the performance of the fund and assess any changes in risk exposure.
- **Implement Risk Management Tools:** Use financial instruments such as derivatives to hedge against potential losses.

### Canadian Context and Regulations

In Canada, alternative investment funds are subject to specific regulations and guidelines to protect investors. The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) oversees the conduct of investment firms and ensures compliance with regulatory standards. Investors should familiarize themselves with these regulations to ensure their investments align with legal requirements.
