## 20.19 Hedge Fund Features

Hedge funds represent a unique class of investment vehicles that stand apart from traditional mutual funds and other investment products due to their distinctive features and operational strategies. This section delves into the characteristics that define hedge funds, focusing on incentive fees, liquidity constraints, and their implications for investors, particularly within the Canadian financial context.

### Unique Features of Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are known for their flexibility in investment strategies, which can include leveraging, short selling, and derivatives trading. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds are typically structured as private investment partnerships and are less regulated, allowing them to pursue a wider range of investment opportunities. This flexibility, however, comes with unique features that investors must understand.

#### Incentive Fees

One of the defining features of hedge funds is their fee structure, which often includes performance-based incentive fees. These fees are designed to align the interests of the fund managers with those of the investors, rewarding managers for generating positive returns.

- **Performance-Based Fees:** Typically, hedge funds charge a management fee (usually around 2% of assets under management) and an incentive fee (commonly 20% of profits). The incentive fee is contingent upon the fund achieving certain performance benchmarks.

- **High-Water Mark:** This is a critical concept in hedge fund fee structures. The high-water mark ensures that fund managers earn performance fees only on net new profits. For example, if a fund's net asset value (NAV) per share was $100 at its peak and then dropped to $90, the manager must bring the NAV back above $100 before earning any performance fees on subsequent gains.

- **Hurdle Rate:** The hurdle rate is the minimum return a hedge fund must achieve before it can charge an incentive fee. This rate is often set as a percentage above a benchmark rate, such as the risk-free rate or a specific index return. The hurdle rate ensures that managers are compensated only for returns that exceed a baseline level of performance.

#### Liquidity Constraints

Hedge funds often impose liquidity constraints, which can impact investors' ability to withdraw their investments. These constraints are necessary due to the nature of the assets held by hedge funds, which may include illiquid investments that cannot be easily sold.

- **Lock-Up Periods:** Many hedge funds require investors to commit their capital for a fixed period, known as the lock-up period, during which withdrawals are not permitted. This period can range from several months to several years.

- **Redemption Notice Periods:** Even after the lock-up period, hedge funds may require investors to provide advance notice, often 30 to 90 days, before withdrawing funds. This allows the fund to manage liquidity and avoid forced sales of assets.

- **Gates and Side Pockets:** In times of market stress, hedge funds may implement gates, which limit the amount of capital that can be withdrawn at any one time. Side pockets are used to segregate illiquid assets, allowing the fund to manage redemptions without impacting the valuation of these assets.

### Implications for Investors

Understanding the unique features of hedge funds is crucial for investors, particularly in terms of risk management and return expectations. The performance-based fee structure incentivizes managers to pursue high returns, but it also introduces the potential for increased risk-taking. Liquidity constraints can limit investors' flexibility, making hedge funds more suitable for those with a longer investment horizon and a higher risk tolerance.

### Canadian Regulatory Context

In Canada, hedge funds are subject to specific regulatory frameworks designed to protect investors while allowing for the flexibility that characterizes these investment vehicles. Key regulations include:

- **National Instrument 81-102:** This regulation governs mutual funds and certain aspects of alternative funds, including hedge funds. It sets out rules regarding disclosure, investment restrictions, and operational requirements.

### Glossary

- **High-Water Mark:** A record of the highest NAV per share reached by a hedge fund, used to determine performance fees.
- **Hurdle Rate:** A minimum rate of return that must be achieved before a performance fee is earned.

### Conclusion

Hedge funds offer unique investment opportunities through their flexible strategies and performance-based incentives. However, these features also introduce complexities and risks that investors must carefully consider. By understanding the intricacies of incentive fees, liquidity constraints, and regulatory frameworks, investors can make informed decisions about incorporating hedge funds into their portfolios.
