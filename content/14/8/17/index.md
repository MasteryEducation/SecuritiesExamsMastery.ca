## 20.16 Minimum Investment Exemption

In the realm of Canadian securities regulation, the Minimum Investment Exemption plays a pivotal role in facilitating access to alternative investments, such as hedge funds, for certain investors. This exemption allows the sale of securities without a prospectus, provided specific conditions are met, thereby streamlining the investment process for qualified investors. Understanding the nuances of this exemption is crucial for financial professionals navigating the Canadian investment landscape.

### Understanding the Minimum Investment Exemption

The Minimum Investment Exemption is a regulatory provision that permits the sale of securities, including hedge fund units, to investors without the need for a prospectus. This exemption is outlined in [National Instrument 45-106](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40645.pdf), which governs prospectus and registration exemptions across Canadian jurisdictions. The primary condition for this exemption is that the investor must make a minimum investment of $150,000.

#### Key Features of the Minimum Investment Exemption

- **Non-Individual Investors:** The exemption is specifically designed for non-individual investors, such as corporations, partnerships, or trusts. This means that individual retail investors are generally not eligible to utilize this exemption.
  
- **Minimum Investment Requirement:** The threshold for the exemption is set at $150,000. This amount must be invested in a single transaction, and the investor must not be induced to invest by any form of leverage or financing provided by the issuer or any related parties.

- **Prospectus-Free Investment:** By meeting the minimum investment requirement, eligible investors can purchase securities without the issuer having to file a prospectus. This reduces the administrative burden and cost for both the issuer and the investor.

### Conditions and Implications

The Minimum Investment Exemption is intended to provide sophisticated investors with greater access to alternative investment opportunities while maintaining a level of investor protection. Here are some conditions and implications associated with this exemption:

- **Sophistication and Risk Tolerance:** The exemption assumes that investors who can commit $150,000 have a certain level of sophistication and risk tolerance. These investors are expected to conduct their own due diligence and understand the risks associated with the investment.

- **Limited Accessibility for Retail Investors:** Since the exemption is not available to individual retail investors, it limits the accessibility of certain high-risk, high-reward investments to a broader audience. This is a protective measure to prevent less experienced investors from exposure to potentially volatile investments.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Issuers must ensure compliance with the conditions of the exemption to avoid regulatory penalties. This includes verifying the investor's eligibility and ensuring that the investment is not financed through prohibited means.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Consider a Canadian pension fund looking to diversify its portfolio by investing in a hedge fund. By utilizing the Minimum Investment Exemption, the pension fund can invest $150,000 or more in the hedge fund without the need for a prospectus. This allows the pension fund to efficiently allocate capital to alternative investments, potentially enhancing returns while managing risk.
