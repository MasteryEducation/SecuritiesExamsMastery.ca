## 20.4 Alternative Assets

Alternative assets have become increasingly popular among investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation. Unlike traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, alternative assets often exhibit low or negative correlation with these conventional investments, providing unique opportunities for risk management and return enhancement. This section delves into the major types of alternative assets, their characteristics, and their strategic importance in investment portfolios, particularly within the Canadian context.

### The Role of Alternative Assets in Portfolio Diversification

Alternative assets are crucial for investors aiming to achieve a well-rounded portfolio. By incorporating assets that behave differently from traditional securities, investors can reduce overall portfolio volatility and enhance returns. The low correlation of alternative assets with traditional asset classes means that they often perform well when stocks and bonds do not, offering a potential hedge against market downturns.

### Major Types of Alternative Assets

#### Commodities

Commodities include agricultural products, metals, and energy resources. Investors can access these markets through derivatives like futures contracts or by holding the physical commodities themselves. Commodities are known for their inflation-hedging properties, as their prices often rise with inflation.

- **Agricultural Products:** These include crops like wheat, corn, and soybeans. Prices can be volatile due to weather conditions and geopolitical factors.
- **Metals:** Precious metals like gold and silver are popular for their intrinsic value and as a hedge against currency devaluation.
- **Energy:** Oil and natural gas are critical commodities with prices influenced by global supply and demand dynamics.

#### Real Estate

Real estate investments encompass both physical properties and securitized forms like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Real estate is valued for its potential to generate income and appreciate over time.

- **Physical Real Estate:** Direct ownership of land and buildings offers control and potential tax benefits but requires significant capital and management.
- **REITs:** These are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate. They provide liquidity and diversification benefits without the need for direct property management.

#### Collectibles

Collectibles such as art, classic automobiles, rare stamps, and coins are tangible assets that can appreciate significantly over time. They are often sought after for their aesthetic value and rarity.

- **Art:** The art market can be lucrative but is highly subjective and requires expertise to navigate.
- **Classic Automobiles:** These can be both a passion and an investment, with values influenced by rarity, condition, and historical significance.

#### Infrastructure

Infrastructure investments involve public works like roads, ports, and airports. These assets provide essential services and can offer stable, long-term returns.

- **Public Works:** Investments in infrastructure are typically less volatile and provide a hedge against inflation due to their essential nature and government backing.

#### Natural Resources

Investments in natural resources include timberland and farmland. These assets offer both direct ownership opportunities and investment through funds.

- **Timberland:** Provides returns through timber sales and land appreciation.
- **Farmland:** Offers income from crop production and potential appreciation in land value.

### Correlation and Inflation-Hedging Properties

Alternative assets are prized for their low or negative correlation with traditional asset classes. This characteristic makes them effective tools for diversification. Additionally, many alternative assets, such as commodities and real estate, have inherent inflation-hedging properties, as their values tend to rise with inflation, preserving purchasing power.

### Glossary

- **REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust):** A company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing real estate.
- **Collectibles:** Rare or unique items that are sought after by collectors for aesthetic or investment purposes.
- **Infrastructure Investment:** Investments in fundamental facilities and systems serving a country, city, or area.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources
