## 20.14 Exempt Market Alternative Funds (Hedge Funds)

Exempt market alternative funds, more commonly known as hedge funds, represent a dynamic and flexible segment of the investment landscape. In Canada, these funds offer sophisticated investors opportunities to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional asset classes. This section delves into the unique characteristics of hedge funds, their investment strategies, structural aspects, and the regulatory framework governing them in Canada.

### Understanding Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are pooled investment vehicles that employ a wide range of strategies to achieve high returns for their investors. Unlike traditional mutual funds, hedge funds are not restricted by the same regulatory constraints, allowing them greater flexibility in their investment approaches. This flexibility enables hedge funds to engage in short selling, leverage, and the use of derivatives, which can enhance returns but also increase risk.

### Investment Strategies of Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are renowned for their diverse and often complex investment strategies. These strategies can be broadly categorized into several types:

1. **Long/Short Equity:** This strategy involves taking long positions in undervalued stocks while shorting overvalued ones. The goal is to capitalize on both rising and falling markets.

2. **Market Neutral:** Aiming to reduce market risk, this strategy involves balancing long and short positions to minimize exposure to market movements.

3. **Global Macro:** Hedge funds using this strategy make investment decisions based on macroeconomic trends, such as interest rates, currency movements, and geopolitical events.

4. **Event-Driven:** These funds focus on corporate events like mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcies, seeking to profit from the price movements resulting from these events.

5. **Quantitative:** Utilizing mathematical models and algorithms, quantitative funds analyze large datasets to identify investment opportunities.

### Structural Aspects of Hedge Funds

Hedge funds in Canada are typically structured as either trusts or limited partnerships. Each structure has its own legal and operational implications:

- **Limited Partnership:** This is a common structure for hedge funds, where at least one partner (the general partner) has unlimited liability, while the limited partners have liability only up to the amount they have invested. This structure allows for flexibility in management and tax efficiency.

- **Trust:** In this arrangement, a trustee holds the fund's assets on behalf of the beneficiaries (investors). Trusts offer a fiduciary framework that can be advantageous for certain investment strategies.

#### Glossary

- **Limited Partnership:** A form of partnership where at least one partner has limited liability, while others have full liability.
- **Trust:** A fiduciary arrangement holding assets on behalf of beneficiaries.

### Regulatory Framework

In Canada, hedge funds operate within a regulatory framework designed to protect investors while allowing for innovation and growth in the financial sector. Key regulations include:

- **National Instrument 81-102:** This regulation outlines the rules and standards for mutual funds and non-redeemable investment funds, including certain hedge funds. It covers aspects such as fund governance, disclosure, and investment restrictions.

For more detailed information on these regulations, you can refer to the [National Instrument 81-102 document](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40642.pdf).

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of hedge fund strategies, consider the following Canadian scenarios:

- **Canadian Pension Funds:** Many Canadian pension funds allocate a portion of their portfolios to hedge funds to achieve diversification and enhance returns. For instance, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) has been known to invest in hedge funds that employ global macro strategies to hedge against currency risks.

- **Major Canadian Banks:** Institutions like RBC and TD have proprietary trading desks that utilize hedge fund strategies to manage their own investment portfolios, often engaging in long/short equity and market-neutral strategies to optimize returns.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When investing in hedge funds, it is crucial to consider the following best practices and potential challenges:

- **Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough research on the fund's strategy, management team, and historical performance. Understanding the fund's risk profile and alignment with your investment goals is essential.

- **Risk Management:** Hedge funds can be volatile, and their use of leverage and derivatives can amplify losses. Ensure that the fund has robust risk management practices in place.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Stay informed about the regulatory environment and ensure that the fund complies with all relevant regulations.
