## Overview of Chapter 20

### Introduction to Alternative Investments

Alternative investments represent a diverse category of assets that differ from traditional investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, and cash. These include hedge funds, private equity, real estate, commodities, and alternative mutual funds. In recent years, alternative investments have gained popularity due to their potential to enhance portfolio diversification, provide unique risk-return profiles, and generate alpha—returns above the market average.

#### Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are lightly regulated investment funds that employ a variety of strategies, including leverage, derivatives, and short selling, to achieve high returns. They are typically accessible to accredited investors due to their complex nature and higher risk profile. Hedge funds aim to deliver absolute returns regardless of market conditions, making them an attractive option for sophisticated investors seeking to diversify their portfolios.

#### Alternative Mutual Funds

Alternative mutual funds, also known as liquid alts, combine the strategies of hedge funds with the liquidity and transparency of traditional mutual funds. These funds allow retail investors to access alternative strategies while maintaining the regulatory oversight and daily liquidity associated with mutual funds. This democratization of alternative investments has expanded the range of tools available to individual investors.

### Benefits and Risks of Alternative Investments

#### Benefits

1. **Diversification**: Alternative investments often have low correlation with traditional asset classes, providing diversification benefits that can reduce overall portfolio risk.
2. **Alpha Generation**: By employing sophisticated strategies, alternative investments have the potential to generate alpha, offering returns that exceed those of traditional investments.
3. **Access to Unique Opportunities**: Alternative investments can provide exposure to niche markets and opportunities not available through conventional investments.

#### Risks

1. **Complexity**: The strategies employed by alternative investments can be complex and difficult to understand, requiring a higher level of due diligence.
2. **Liquidity Risk**: Many alternative investments are less liquid than traditional assets, potentially leading to challenges in buying or selling positions quickly.
3. **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in regulations can impact the operations and strategies of alternative investments, affecting their performance and accessibility.

### Structural Differences Between Alternative Investments and Conventional Mutual Funds

Alternative investments differ structurally from conventional mutual funds in several key ways:

- **Investment Strategies**: While mutual funds typically invest in stocks and bonds, alternative investments may use derivatives, leverage, and short selling to achieve their objectives.
- **Regulation**: Hedge funds are less regulated than mutual funds, allowing for greater flexibility in strategy but also increasing risk.
- **Liquidity**: Alternative mutual funds offer daily liquidity, unlike many traditional hedge funds, which may have lock-up periods and redemption restrictions.

### Expansion of Retail Investor Access

Recent regulatory changes have expanded retail investor access to alternative strategies. In Canada, the introduction of alternative mutual funds has allowed individual investors to benefit from sophisticated investment strategies previously reserved for institutional investors. This shift has been facilitated by regulatory bodies such as the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), which ensure that these products meet specific standards of transparency and investor protection.

### Key Topics Preview

#### Diversification

Diversification is a fundamental principle in portfolio management, aiming to reduce risk by spreading investments across various asset classes. Alternative investments play a crucial role in diversification by providing exposure to assets that behave differently from traditional stocks and bonds.

#### Alpha Generation

Alpha represents the excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index. Alternative investments seek to generate alpha through active management and sophisticated strategies, offering the potential for higher returns.

#### Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier is a concept from Modern Portfolio Theory that represents the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk. Alternative investments can help investors achieve a more favorable position on the efficient frontier by enhancing diversification and return potential.
