## 20.15 Who Can Invest in Hedge Funds?

Hedge funds are sophisticated investment vehicles that offer the potential for high returns, but they also come with significant risks and complexities. In Canada, access to hedge funds is restricted to certain types of investors who meet specific qualifications. This section will explore the qualifications required to invest in hedge funds, focusing on the three common prospectus exemptions: Minimum Investment Exemption, Accredited Investor Exemption, and Offering Memorandum Exemption. Understanding these exemptions is crucial for both institutional and individual investors who wish to participate in hedge fund investments.

### Investor Qualifications for Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are typically not available to the general public due to their complex nature and the risks involved. Instead, they are accessible to investors who meet certain financial criteria, ensuring that only those with sufficient financial knowledge and resources can invest. These criteria are outlined in various exemptions under Canadian securities regulations.

### Overview of Prospectus Exemptions

In Canada, hedge funds are often sold under prospectus exemptions, which allow them to be offered without the need for a full prospectus. The three most common exemptions are:

1. **Minimum Investment Exemption**
2. **Accredited Investor Exemption**
3. **Offering Memorandum Exemption**

Each exemption has specific criteria that investors must meet to qualify.

#### Minimum Investment Exemption

The Minimum Investment Exemption allows investors to participate in hedge funds by making a substantial minimum investment. This exemption is based on the premise that investors who can afford to make large investments are likely to have the financial acumen and resources to understand and bear the risks associated with hedge funds.

- **Criteria:** Typically, the minimum investment required is CAD 150,000. This amount must be invested in a single transaction, and the investor must not be an individual unless they qualify as an accredited investor.

- **Example:** A Canadian pension fund might use this exemption to invest in a hedge fund, given its large pool of assets and investment expertise.

#### Accredited Investor Exemption

The Accredited Investor Exemption is designed for individuals and entities that meet certain financial thresholds, indicating their ability to understand and manage the risks of hedge fund investments.

- **Individual Criteria:** An individual must have net financial assets exceeding CAD 1 million, or net assets of at least CAD 5 million. Alternatively, they can qualify based on income, with an annual income exceeding CAD 200,000 (or CAD 300,000 combined with a spouse) in the past two years.

- **Institutional Criteria:** Entities such as banks, insurance companies, and investment funds automatically qualify as accredited investors.

- **Example:** A high-net-worth individual in Canada with significant investment experience might qualify under this exemption to diversify their portfolio with hedge fund investments.

#### Offering Memorandum Exemption

The Offering Memorandum Exemption allows hedge funds to be offered to investors through a legal document known as an offering memorandum. This document provides detailed information about the investment, including risks, financial statements, and management details.

- **Criteria:** Investors must sign a risk acknowledgment form and meet certain financial criteria, which vary by province. This exemption is more flexible and accessible than the other two.

- **Example:** A small business owner in Ontario might use this exemption to invest in a hedge fund after reviewing the offering memorandum and understanding the associated risks.

### Institutional vs. Individual Investors

The criteria for investing in hedge funds can differ significantly between institutional and individual investors. Institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, often have fewer restrictions due to their size and expertise. Individual investors, on the other hand, must meet specific financial thresholds to qualify under the exemptions.

### Glossary

- **Accredited Investor:** An individual or entity that meets certain financial criteria, allowing them to invest in unregistered securities. This includes having a high net worth or income level, as defined by securities regulations.

- **Offering Memorandum:** A legal document provided to potential investors when securities are being offered without a prospectus. It includes detailed information about the investment, such as risks, financial statements, and management details.
