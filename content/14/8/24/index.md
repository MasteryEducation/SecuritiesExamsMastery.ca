## 20.23 Funds of Hedge Funds

In the realm of alternative investments, Funds of Hedge Funds (FoHF) play a pivotal role in offering investors a diversified approach to hedge fund investing. This section delves into the structure, benefits, and challenges associated with FoHFs, particularly within the Canadian financial context.

### Understanding Fund of Hedge Funds (FoHF)

A Fund of Hedge Funds (FoHF) is an investment vehicle designed to achieve diversification and risk management by investing in a portfolio of hedge funds. This structure allows investors to access a variety of hedge fund strategies and managers, potentially reducing the volatility and risk associated with investing in a single hedge fund.

#### Structure of FoHFs

FoHFs can be categorized into two main types based on their investment strategies:

1. **Single-Strategy, Multi-Manager Funds**: These funds invest in multiple hedge funds that employ similar investment strategies. For example, a single-strategy FoHF might focus exclusively on long/short equity funds, selecting several managers who specialize in this approach. This structure aims to capitalize on the expertise of different managers within a specific strategy, enhancing returns while mitigating the risk of underperformance by any single manager.

2. **Multi-Strategy, Multi-Manager Funds**: These funds invest in hedge funds employing a diverse range of strategies, such as equity, fixed income, macro, and arbitrage. By diversifying across various strategies and managers, multi-strategy FoHFs aim to achieve a more balanced risk-return profile. This approach can be particularly beneficial in volatile markets, where different strategies may perform better under varying economic conditions.

### Advantages of Investing in FoHFs

Investing in FoHFs offers several advantages, making them an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to hedge funds:

- **Diversification**: By investing in a portfolio of hedge funds, FoHFs provide diversification across different strategies and managers, reducing the impact of poor performance by any single fund.

- **Reduced Volatility**: The diversified nature of FoHFs can lead to reduced volatility compared to investing in individual hedge funds, as the performance of different strategies may offset each other.

- **Professional Management**: FoHFs are managed by experienced professionals who conduct thorough due diligence on the underlying hedge funds, selecting those with strong track records and robust risk management practices.

### Disadvantages of Investing in FoHFs

Despite their benefits, FoHFs also present certain challenges and drawbacks:

- **Additional Costs**: FoHFs typically charge an additional layer of fees on top of the fees charged by the underlying hedge funds. This can erode returns, particularly in periods of modest performance.

- **Lack of Guarantees**: Like all investments, FoHFs do not guarantee returns and are subject to market risks. The performance of FoHFs depends on the success of the underlying hedge funds and the manager's ability to select and allocate effectively.

### Regulatory Considerations in Canada

In Canada, FoHFs are subject to specific regulatory requirements to protect investors and ensure transparency. The [National Instrument 81-102](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploads/r_40642.pdf) outlines the rules governing mutual funds, including FoHFs, ensuring they adhere to standards of disclosure, valuation, and risk management.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds often utilize FoHFs as part of their investment strategy to achieve diversification and manage risk. For instance, a pension fund might allocate a portion of its portfolio to a multi-strategy FoHF to gain exposure to various hedge fund strategies without the need to directly invest in individual hedge funds.

### Case Study: RBC's Approach to FoHFs

RBC, one of Canada's largest banks, offers FoHFs as part of its alternative investment solutions. By leveraging its extensive research capabilities and global reach, RBC selects a diversified portfolio of hedge funds, aiming to deliver consistent returns while managing risk.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When investing in FoHFs, consider the following best practices and potential challenges:

- **Conduct Thorough Due Diligence**: Evaluate the track record, risk management practices, and fee structures of both the FoHF and the underlying hedge funds.

- **Understand the Fee Structure**: Be aware of the additional layer of fees associated with FoHFs and assess their impact on potential returns.

- **Monitor Performance Regularly**: Regularly review the performance of the FoHF and its underlying funds to ensure alignment with your investment objectives.

### Conclusion

Funds of Hedge Funds offer a compelling way to access the diverse world of hedge fund investing, providing diversification, professional management, and reduced volatility. However, investors must carefully consider the additional costs and lack of guarantees associated with these investments. By understanding the structure, benefits, and challenges of FoHFs, investors can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
