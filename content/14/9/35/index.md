## 21.34 Alternative Strategy Fund Performance Measurement

In the realm of alternative investments, evaluating the performance of strategy funds requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond traditional metrics. This section delves into the various performance measurement tools applicable to alternative strategy funds, emphasizing the importance of combining risk measures with risk-adjusted return metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of fund performance.

### Understanding Alternative Strategy Funds

Alternative strategy funds encompass a wide range of investment vehicles, including hedge funds, private equity, and real estate funds. These funds often employ complex strategies that can include leverage, derivatives, and short selling, making performance measurement a challenging yet crucial task.

### Key Performance Measurement Tools

#### 1. **Absolute Return Measures**

Absolute return measures focus on the total return of an investment over a specific period, without considering the risk involved. While useful for understanding raw performance, they do not provide insights into the risk taken to achieve those returns.

#### 2. **Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics**

Risk-adjusted return metrics are essential for comparing investments with different risk profiles. They provide a more holistic view of performance by accounting for the level of risk taken. Key metrics include:

- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures the excess return per unit of risk (standard deviation). A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.
  
- **Sortino Ratio:** Similar to the Sharpe ratio, but focuses only on downside risk, providing a more accurate picture of performance for funds with asymmetric return distributions.

- **Treynor Ratio:** Evaluates returns earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of market risk (beta).

#### 3. **Benchmarking**

Benchmarking involves comparing a fund's performance against a relevant index or peer group. For alternative strategy funds, selecting an appropriate benchmark can be challenging due to the unique strategies employed. Custom benchmarks or a blend of indices may be necessary.

#### 4. **Alpha Measurement**

Alpha represents the excess return of a fund relative to its benchmark, adjusted for risk. Positive alpha indicates that a fund has outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.

### Importance of Combining Risk Measures

To obtain a comprehensive view of an alternative strategy fund's performance, it is crucial to use a combination of risk measures and risk-adjusted return metrics. This approach helps investors understand not only the returns generated but also the risks undertaken to achieve those returns.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Consider a Canadian pension fund investing in alternative strategy funds. By employing a combination of the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and alpha measurement, the fund can evaluate the performance of its alternative investments relative to its risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### Case Study: Major Canadian Bank

A major Canadian bank, such as RBC, might use these performance measurement tools to assess its hedge fund offerings. By comparing the funds' risk-adjusted returns to custom benchmarks, the bank can provide clients with insights into the funds' performance and risk profiles.

### Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, alternative strategy funds are subject to specific regulations and guidelines set by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and provincial regulators. Understanding these regulations is crucial for compliance and effective performance measurement.

### Resources for Further Exploration

- **Books:**
  - "Performance Measurement in Investment Management" by Philip Lawton provides an in-depth exploration of performance measurement techniques.

- **Open-Source Financial Tools:**
  - Tools like R and Python libraries (e.g., Quantlib) can be used to calculate performance metrics and conduct risk analysis.

- **Canadian Financial Institutions:**
  - Institutions such as the Bank of Canada and CIRO offer resources and guidelines for performance measurement and regulatory compliance.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### Best Practices

- **Diversify Metrics:** Use a combination of absolute and risk-adjusted return metrics to gain a comprehensive view of performance.
- **Select Appropriate Benchmarks:** Ensure benchmarks align with the fund's strategy and risk profile.
- **Regularly Review Performance:** Continuously monitor and adjust performance measurement strategies to reflect changing market conditions and fund strategies.

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Risk:** Focusing solely on absolute returns without considering risk can lead to misleading conclusions.
- **Inappropriate Benchmarks:** Using an ill-suited benchmark can distort performance evaluation.

### Conclusion

Measuring the performance of alternative strategy funds requires a sophisticated approach that incorporates both risk and return. By leveraging a combination of performance measurement tools and adhering to Canadian regulatory guidelines, investors can make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies.
