## 21.9 Risk Measures

In the realm of alternative investments, understanding and managing risk is crucial for achieving desired financial outcomes. This section delves into various risk measures that are essential for evaluating the performance and volatility of alternative investments. By comprehending these metrics, investors can make informed decisions and optimize their portfolios within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Absolute Risk

Absolute risk refers to the total variability or volatility of returns from an investment. It encompasses all types of volatility, providing a comprehensive view of the potential fluctuations in investment value. Absolute risk is particularly relevant for alternative investments, which often exhibit higher volatility compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds.

#### Practical Example:
Consider a Canadian hedge fund that invests in a diverse range of assets, including commodities and real estate. The absolute risk of this fund would account for the total variability in returns due to market fluctuations, geopolitical events, and other factors.

### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the dispersion of returns around the mean. It is a widely used metric for assessing the volatility of an investment. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in returns, suggesting higher risk.

#### Practical Example:
A Canadian mutual fund with a standard deviation of 10% is considered more volatile than one with a standard deviation of 5%. Investors seeking stability may prefer the latter, while those willing to accept higher risk for potentially greater returns might choose the former.

### Skew

Skew measures the asymmetry of the return distribution. A positively skewed distribution indicates that returns are more likely to be above the mean, while a negatively skewed distribution suggests the opposite. Skew is important for understanding the likelihood of extreme returns.

#### Practical Example:
An alternative investment strategy employed by a Canadian pension fund may exhibit positive skew, indicating a higher probability of achieving returns above the average. This can be attractive to investors seeking upside potential.

### Kurtosis

Kurtosis measures the 'tailedness' of the return distribution. High kurtosis indicates a distribution with fat tails, meaning there is a higher likelihood of extreme returns. This measure helps investors assess the risk of rare, significant events.

#### Practical Example:
A Canadian venture capital fund might have high kurtosis, reflecting the potential for large gains or losses due to the unpredictable nature of startup investments.

### Drawdown and Maximum Drawdown

Drawdown refers to the peak-to-trough decline in the value of an investment. Maximum drawdown is the largest such decline over a specific period. These measures are critical for understanding the potential downside risk of an investment.

#### Practical Example:
A Canadian real estate investment trust (REIT) may experience a drawdown during a market downturn. The maximum drawdown provides insight into the worst-case scenario for investors.

### Time to Recovery

Time to recovery measures the duration required for an investment to recover from a drawdown. This metric is vital for assessing the resilience of an investment strategy.

#### Practical Example:
A Canadian equity fund that quickly recovers from a drawdown may be more appealing to investors seeking stability and long-term growth.

### Percentage of Profitable/Losing Months

This measure indicates the frequency of positive or negative monthly returns. It provides insight into the consistency of an investment's performance.

#### Practical Example:
A Canadian alternative investment fund with a high percentage of profitable months may be perceived as more reliable, attracting risk-averse investors.

### Glossary

- **Absolute Risk:** The total variance in returns, encompassing all types of volatility.
- **Standard Deviation:** A statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation in a set of values.
- **Skew:** A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of returns.
- **Kurtosis:** A statistical measure that describes the shape of the distribution's tails in relation to its overall shape.
- **Drawdown:** A peak-to-trough decline in the value of an investment.

### Best Practices and Common Challenges

When assessing risk measures, consider the following best practices and challenges:

- **Diversification:** Diversifying across asset classes can mitigate absolute risk and reduce volatility.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously monitor risk measures to adapt to changing market conditions.
- **Understanding Limitations:** Recognize the limitations of each risk measure and use them in conjunction with other metrics for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure compliance with Canadian financial regulations when implementing risk management strategies.

By applying these best practices, investors can effectively manage risk and optimize their portfolios for success in the Canadian market.
