## 21.2 Alternative Investment Strategies

In the ever-evolving landscape of finance, alternative investment strategies have emerged as powerful tools for achieving higher returns and diversification. These strategies, which include relative value, event-driven, and directional approaches, offer investors unique opportunities to enhance their portfolios beyond traditional asset classes. This section delves into the intricacies of these strategies, their increasing role in modern investment portfolios, and their application within the Canadian financial context.

### Overview of Alternative Investment Strategies

Alternative investment strategies can be broadly categorized into three main types: relative value, event-driven, and directional strategies. Each of these strategies employs distinct methodologies to capitalize on market inefficiencies and generate returns.

#### 1. Relative Value Strategies

Relative value strategies aim to exploit pricing discrepancies between related financial instruments. These strategies often involve pairs trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells two correlated securities to profit from their price convergence or divergence. For example, a Canadian hedge fund might engage in a relative value strategy by trading the stocks of two major Canadian banks, such as RBC and TD, based on their historical price relationship.

Relative value strategies are typically market-neutral, meaning they seek to minimize exposure to overall market movements (beta) while focusing on generating excess returns (alpha). This approach can be particularly appealing in volatile markets, as it allows investors to achieve returns independent of market direction.

#### 2. Event-Driven Strategies

Event-driven strategies focus on exploiting opportunities arising from specific corporate events, such as mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, or restructurings. These strategies rely on the anticipation of how such events will impact the prices of the involved securities.

A common example of an event-driven strategy is merger arbitrage, where an investor buys the stock of a company being acquired and shorts the stock of the acquiring company. The goal is to profit from the spread between the current market price and the acquisition price. In the Canadian context, event-driven strategies might involve analyzing the impact of regulatory changes on major Canadian industries, such as energy or telecommunications.

#### 3. Directional Strategies

Directional strategies involve taking positions based on anticipated market movements. These strategies can be long or short, depending on whether the investor expects the market to rise or fall. Directional strategies are often employed by hedge funds and involve significant risk, as they are highly dependent on market trends.

In Canada, directional strategies might include investing in sectors poised for growth, such as technology or renewable energy, based on macroeconomic trends and government policies. These strategies require a deep understanding of market dynamics and the ability to accurately predict future movements.

### The Role of Alternative Investment Strategies in Achieving Higher Returns and Diversification

Alternative investment strategies play a crucial role in modern portfolio management by offering avenues for higher returns and diversification. Traditional asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, are often subject to market volatility and economic cycles. In contrast, alternative strategies can provide uncorrelated returns, reducing overall portfolio risk.

#### Achieving Higher Returns

By exploiting market inefficiencies and capitalizing on specific events, alternative strategies can generate alpha, or excess returns, beyond what is achievable through traditional investments. For instance, a Canadian pension fund might incorporate relative value and event-driven strategies to enhance its overall return profile while maintaining a balanced risk exposure.

#### Enhancing Diversification

Diversification is a key principle in investment management, aimed at reducing risk by spreading investments across various asset classes. Alternative strategies offer diversification benefits by introducing non-traditional assets and strategies into a portfolio. This can help mitigate the impact of market downturns and enhance overall portfolio stability.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of alternative investment strategies, consider the following examples:

#### Case Study: Canadian Pension Fund

A large Canadian pension fund seeks to enhance its portfolio returns while maintaining a conservative risk profile. By incorporating relative value strategies, the fund identifies pricing discrepancies between Canadian government bonds and corporate bonds, capitalizing on interest rate changes and credit spreads. This approach allows the fund to achieve market-neutral returns, reducing exposure to interest rate volatility.

#### Example: Event-Driven Strategy in the Energy Sector

A Canadian hedge fund anticipates regulatory changes in the energy sector, leading to potential mergers and acquisitions among major players. By employing an event-driven strategy, the fund invests in companies likely to be involved in these transactions, profiting from the resulting price movements. This strategy leverages the fund's expertise in analyzing regulatory impacts and industry trends.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When implementing alternative investment strategies, investors should consider the following best practices and potential challenges:

#### Best Practices

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Investors in Canada must navigate a complex regulatory landscape when implementing alternative investment strategies.

These organizations provide guidelines and oversight to ensure fair and transparent markets.
