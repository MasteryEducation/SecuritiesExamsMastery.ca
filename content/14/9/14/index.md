## 21.13 Suitability of Alternative Investment Strategies

Alternative investment strategies have gained popularity among investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and achieve specific financial objectives. However, these strategies are not universally suitable for all investors. Understanding the suitability of alternative strategies is crucial for aligning investment choices with individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and knowledge. This section delves into the key considerations for determining the suitability of alternative investment strategies, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Understanding Suitability

**Suitability** refers to the appropriateness of an investment choice based on an investor's financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and knowledge. In the context of alternative investments, suitability involves evaluating whether these strategies align with the investor's goals and capacity to understand and manage the associated risks.

### Characteristics of Investors Suited for Alternative Strategies

Investors who are most likely to benefit from alternative strategies, particularly liquid alternatives, typically exhibit specific characteristics:

#### 1. Knowledge

Investors with a solid understanding of portfolio theory, derivatives, and complex investment strategies are better equipped to navigate the intricacies of alternative investments. These investors can comprehend the potential risks and rewards, enabling them to make informed decisions.

#### 2. Specific Objectives

Alternative strategies are often pursued by investors with specific objectives, such as achieving absolute returns, enhancing risk-adjusted returns, and diversifying their portfolios. These strategies can provide exposure to non-traditional asset classes and investment approaches, which may not be available through conventional investments.

#### 3. Medium-Term Investment Horizon

Alternative investments are generally suited for investors with a medium-term investment horizon, typically spanning several years. This time frame allows investors to weather short-term market fluctuations and capitalize on the potential benefits of alternative strategies.

#### 4. Liquidity Needs

Investors with short- to medium-term liquidity requirements can benefit from the flexibility offered by liquid alternatives. These investments provide access to capital without significant loss, making them suitable for investors who may need to access their funds within a specific period.

### Mitigating Risk with Alternative Strategies

While alternative strategies are often associated with the pursuit of higher returns, they can also play a crucial role in risk mitigation. By incorporating alternative investments into a diversified portfolio, investors can reduce overall portfolio volatility and enhance risk-adjusted returns. This is achieved through exposure to asset classes and strategies that have low correlations with traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds.

#### Case Study: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), have successfully integrated alternative strategies into their portfolios to achieve diversification and risk mitigation. By investing in private equity, infrastructure, and hedge funds, these institutions have managed to achieve stable returns while minimizing exposure to market volatility.

### Regulatory Considerations and Resources

Investors considering alternative strategies must be aware of the regulatory landscape governing these investments in Canada. The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and provincial regulatory bodies provide guidelines to ensure that investment products are suitable for investors.

#### Key Resources

- **Books:** "Portfolio Construction and Risk Management" by Donald R. Chambers offers insights into building diversified portfolios and managing risk, making it a valuable resource for investors exploring alternative strategies.
- **Websites:** The [Investment Funds Institute of Canada (IFIC) on Suitability](https://www.ific.ca/en) provides information on regulatory requirements and best practices for ensuring investment suitability.

### Glossary

- **Suitability:** The appropriateness of an investment choice based on the investor’s financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and knowledge.
- **Liquidity Needs:** The requirement for investors to access their investment capital within a specific period without significant loss.

### Conclusion

Alternative investment strategies offer unique opportunities for investors seeking diversification, risk mitigation, and specific financial objectives. However, these strategies are not universally suitable and require careful consideration of the investor's knowledge, objectives, investment horizon, and liquidity needs. By understanding the suitability of alternative strategies, investors can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
