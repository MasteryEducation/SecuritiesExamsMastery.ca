## 21.33 Relationship Disclosure Information

In the realm of alternative investments, transparency is paramount. Relationship disclosure information serves as a cornerstone for building trust and clarity between fund managers and investors. This section delves into the significance of relationship disclosure, its essential components, and the methods of delivering and maintaining these disclosures in compliance with Canadian financial regulations.

### The Importance of Relationship Disclosure

Relationship disclosure is a critical element in the financial services industry, particularly in the context of alternative investments. It ensures that investors are fully informed about the nature of their relationship with fund managers, the services provided, and the associated costs. This transparency is vital for several reasons:

1. **Building Trust:** By clearly outlining the terms and conditions of the investment relationship, fund managers can foster trust with their clients. Trust is a fundamental component of any financial relationship, and transparency through disclosure is key to establishing it.

2. **Informed Decision-Making:** Investors equipped with comprehensive information about their accounts and the services offered can make more informed decisions. This empowerment leads to better alignment of investment strategies with personal financial goals.

3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhering to relationship disclosure requirements is not only a best practice but also a regulatory obligation under Canadian financial laws. Compliance helps avoid legal repercussions and enhances the credibility of the fund manager.

### Key Components of Relationship Disclosure Documents

Relationship disclosure documents must encompass several critical components to ensure comprehensive communication between fund managers and investors. These components include:

#### Nature or Type of the Account

The disclosure should clearly define the type of account being offered, whether it is a discretionary account, a non-discretionary account, or another type. This distinction is crucial as it determines the level of control and decision-making authority the investor retains.

#### Products and Services Offered

Investors should be informed about the range of products and services available through their account. This includes details on alternative investment options, such as hedge funds, private equity, and real estate investments, as well as any ancillary services like financial planning or advisory services.

#### Procedures for Handling Cash and Cheques

Clear procedures for the handling of cash and cheques must be outlined to prevent any potential mismanagement of funds. This includes details on how deposits and withdrawals are processed, timelines for transactions, and any associated fees.

#### Dealer’s Obligations Regarding Suitability and Responsibility

Fund managers have a duty to ensure that the investment products and services offered are suitable for the investor's financial situation and objectives. The disclosure should articulate the dealer's obligations in assessing suitability and the steps taken to fulfill this responsibility.

#### Terms of Account Reporting

Investors should be informed about the frequency and format of account reporting. This includes details on how performance reports, transaction statements, and other relevant documents will be delivered, ensuring investors have regular and clear insights into their investment performance.

#### Disclosure of Fees and Compensation Structures

A transparent breakdown of all fees and compensation structures is essential. This includes management fees, performance fees, and any other charges that may apply. Understanding these costs allows investors to evaluate the true cost of their investments and compare them with other options.

### Methods of Delivering Relationship Disclosure Information

Delivering relationship disclosure information effectively is as important as the content itself. Fund managers can employ various methods to ensure that disclosures are received and understood by investors:

- **Electronic Delivery:** In today's digital age, electronic delivery via email or secure online portals is a common and efficient method. It allows for quick dissemination and easy access to documents.

- **Physical Delivery:** For investors who prefer traditional methods, physical delivery of documents via mail is still a viable option. This method may be necessary for clients without reliable internet access.

- **In-Person Meetings:** Discussing disclosures during in-person meetings can enhance understanding and provide an opportunity for investors to ask questions and seek clarification.

Maintaining records of the provision of relationship disclosure information is crucial for compliance and accountability. Fund managers should keep detailed records of when and how disclosures were delivered, as well as any acknowledgments or confirmations received from investors.
