## 21.32 Key Due Diligence Areas

In the realm of alternative investments, due diligence is a critical process that ensures informed decision-making and risk mitigation. This section delves into the eight primary areas of inquiry that form the backbone of a comprehensive due diligence process. Each area is crucial for evaluating the viability and potential of an investment opportunity, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape.

### 1. Structure of the Investment Management Organization

The first step in due diligence involves assessing the **structure of the investment management organization**. This includes examining the firm's background, ownership, and governance. Understanding the governance framework is essential as it dictates how the firm ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency with its stakeholders. 

- **Background and Ownership:** Investigate the history of the firm, including its founding, growth trajectory, and ownership structure. Is it privately held, publicly traded, or part of a larger conglomerate? Each ownership model presents unique advantages and challenges.

- **Governance:** Evaluate the governance practices in place. This includes the composition of the board of directors, the presence of independent directors, and the firm's adherence to regulatory standards. Strong governance is indicative of a firm's commitment to ethical practices and long-term sustainability.

### 2. Investment Management Information

The second area focuses on **investment management information**, which encompasses the firm's assets under management (AUM), investment strategies, and the expertise of its managers.

- **Assets Under Management (AUM):** AUM is a key indicator of a firm's scale and market influence. Larger AUM may suggest stability and resources, but also potential challenges in nimbleness and personalized service.

- **Investment Strategies:** Analyze the firm's investment strategies. Are they aligned with your investment goals? Do they employ traditional or innovative approaches? Understanding the strategy helps assess the potential for returns and risk exposure.

- **Manager Expertise:** The experience and track record of the investment managers are paramount. Review their past performance, educational background, and industry reputation. A seasoned manager with a proven track record can significantly enhance the likelihood of achieving desired investment outcomes.

### 3. Risk Analysis

**Risk analysis** is a cornerstone of due diligence, focusing on how the manager identifies, quantifies, and manages various risks.

- **Risk Identification and Quantification:** Determine how the firm identifies potential risks, such as market, credit, operational, and liquidity risks. Quantifying these risks involves using models and metrics to assess their potential impact.

- **Risk Management:** Evaluate the risk management strategies in place. This includes hedging techniques, diversification strategies, and the use of derivatives. Effective risk management is crucial for protecting investments from unforeseen market fluctuations.

### 4. Operations

The **operations** of an investment firm are integral to its functionality and reliability. This area involves reviewing service providers, custody arrangements, and operational controls.

- **Service Providers:** Identify the third-party service providers involved, such as auditors, custodians, and legal advisors. Reputable service providers enhance the credibility and reliability of the investment firm.

- **Custody Arrangements:** Ensure that the firm's custody arrangements are secure and transparent. This involves understanding where and how assets are held and the measures in place to protect them.

- **Operational Controls:** Assess the firm's internal controls and processes. This includes technology infrastructure, compliance procedures, and disaster recovery plans. Robust operational controls minimize the risk of fraud and operational failures.

### 5. Fund Structure

The **fund structure** is a critical component of due diligence, examining the form of the offering, tax implications, and liquidity terms.

- **Form of the Offering:** Understand the legal structure of the fund, whether it's a mutual fund, hedge fund, or private equity fund. Each structure has distinct regulatory and operational characteristics.

- **Tax Implications:** Analyze the tax implications of the investment. This includes understanding the tax treatment of returns and the impact of Canadian tax laws on the investment's profitability.

- **Liquidity Terms:** Evaluate the liquidity terms of the investment. How easily can you enter or exit the investment? Are there lock-up periods or redemption fees? Liquidity is a crucial factor in aligning the investment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. Investment Performance

**Investment performance** analysis involves scrutinizing historical performance, consistency, and benchmarking.

- **Historical Performance:** Review the fund's historical performance data. This includes returns over various time periods and market conditions. Historical performance provides insights into the fund's resilience and adaptability.

- **Consistency:** Assess the consistency of returns. Consistent performance is often more desirable than sporadic high returns, as it indicates stability and effective risk management.

- **Benchmarking:** Compare the fund's performance against relevant benchmarks. This helps determine whether the fund is outperforming or underperforming relative to its peers and the broader market.

### 7. Account Structure and Composition

Understanding the **account structure and composition** is vital for assessing client demographics and asset allocations.

- **Client Demographics:** Analyze the composition of the client base. Are they institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or retail investors? The client demographic can influence the fund's investment strategy and risk profile.

- **Asset Allocations:** Review the fund's asset allocation strategy. How are assets distributed across different asset classes and sectors? A well-diversified portfolio can mitigate risks and enhance returns.

### 8. Fees

Finally, scrutinizing the **fees** associated with the investment is essential for understanding the cost structure and its impact on returns.

- **Management Fees:** Determine the management fees charged by the firm. These are typically a percentage of AUM and can significantly affect net returns.

- **Performance Fees:** Evaluate any performance fees, which are often based on the fund's returns exceeding a predefined benchmark. While performance fees can incentivize managers, they can also lead to riskier investment strategies.

- **Other Associated Costs:** Consider other costs, such as administrative fees, redemption fees, and transaction costs. A comprehensive understanding of the fee structure helps assess the true cost of the investment.

### Glossary

- **Governance:** The framework of rules and practices by which a firm ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency in its relationships with stakeholders.
