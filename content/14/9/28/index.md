## 21.27 Managed Futures Strategy

Managed futures strategies are a sophisticated investment approach that involves trading futures contracts to capture market trends. These strategies are employed by professional managers who use futures contracts across various asset classes, including commodities, currencies, and financial instruments, to generate returns. In this section, we will delve into the mechanics of managed futures, explore the trend-following and momentum-based approaches, and discuss the benefits of incorporating managed futures into a diversified investment portfolio.

### Understanding Managed Futures

Managed futures involve the use of futures contracts, which are standardized legal agreements to buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which provides a regulated environment for trading.

#### Futures Contract

A futures contract is a financial derivative that obligates the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a specific asset at a predetermined future date and price. These contracts are used by investors to hedge against price fluctuations or to speculate on price movements.

### Trend-Following and Momentum-Based Approaches

Managed futures managers often employ trend-following and momentum-based strategies to capitalize on market movements. These strategies are based on the premise that markets exhibit trends, and by identifying and following these trends, investors can achieve positive returns.

#### Trend-Following

Trend-following is an investment strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuation of existing market trends. Managers using this approach analyze historical price data to identify trends and make investment decisions based on the direction of these trends. The strategy involves buying assets that are trending upwards and selling those that are trending downwards.

#### Momentum-Based Strategies

Momentum-based strategies focus on the speed and strength of price movements. Managers look for assets that are gaining momentum and invest in them with the expectation that the momentum will continue. This approach is often used in conjunction with trend-following to enhance returns.

### Benefits of Managed Futures

Managed futures offer several benefits that make them an attractive addition to a diversified investment portfolio.

#### Diversification

One of the primary benefits of managed futures is diversification. Because futures contracts can be traded across various asset classes, managed futures provide exposure to a wide range of markets. This diversification can help reduce portfolio risk by spreading investments across different sectors and geographies.

#### Liquidity

Futures contracts are highly liquid, meaning they can be easily bought and sold on exchanges. This liquidity allows investors to quickly adjust their positions in response to market changes, providing flexibility and the ability to capitalize on short-term opportunities.

#### Risk Management

Managed futures strategies often include risk management techniques such as stop-loss orders and position sizing to limit potential losses. These techniques help protect the portfolio from significant drawdowns and contribute to overall risk reduction.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), have been known to incorporate managed futures into their investment strategies. By doing so, they aim to enhance returns while managing risk through diversification and liquidity. These funds often employ professional managers who use sophisticated algorithms and models to identify trends and execute trades.

### Case Study: RBC's Use of Managed Futures

Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has utilized managed futures as part of its alternative investment offerings. By leveraging trend-following and momentum-based strategies, RBC aims to provide clients with exposure to global markets and enhance portfolio performance. This approach allows RBC to offer diversified investment solutions that can adapt to changing market conditions.

### Incorporating Managed Futures into Your Portfolio

For individual investors, incorporating managed futures into a portfolio can provide diversification and potential for enhanced returns. However, it is essential to understand the complexities and risks associated with these strategies. Working with a financial advisor or investment professional can help tailor a managed futures strategy that aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
