## 21.4 Event-Driven Strategies

Event-driven strategies are a subset of alternative investment strategies that aim to capitalize on specific corporate events. These strategies are designed to exploit pricing inefficiencies that arise before, during, or after significant corporate events such as mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, or other restructuring activities. By understanding and anticipating the market's reaction to these events, investors can potentially achieve substantial returns.

### Understanding Event-Driven Strategies

Event-driven strategies focus on identifying and investing in opportunities created by corporate events. These events can lead to temporary mispricing of securities, which skilled investors can exploit. The primary goal is to profit from the market's reaction to these events, which often involves significant changes in a company's valuation.

#### Key Event-Driven Strategies

1. **Merger (Risk Arbitrage) Strategy**

   The merger or risk arbitrage strategy involves taking advantage of the price discrepancies that occur when a merger or acquisition is announced. Typically, this strategy involves buying the stock of the target company and shorting the stock of the acquiring company. The rationale is that the target company's stock price will rise as the merger approaches completion, while the acquiring company's stock may experience downward pressure due to the costs and risks associated with the acquisition.

   **Example:** Consider a scenario where RBC announces its intention to acquire a smaller Canadian bank. An investor using a merger arbitrage strategy would buy shares of the smaller bank, anticipating that its stock price will rise as the merger progresses. Simultaneously, the investor might short RBC's stock, expecting it to face short-term pressure.

       B --> D[Target Stock Price Increases];
       C --> E[Acquiring Stock Price Decreases];
       D --> F[Profit from Target Stock];
       E --> G[Profit from Short Position];
   ```

2. **High-Yield Bond Strategy**

   This strategy involves investing in bonds that are rated below investment grade, often referred to as "junk bonds." These bonds offer higher yields to compensate for their increased risk. Investors in high-yield bonds aim to benefit from the higher interest payments and potential capital appreciation if the issuing company's financial situation improves.

   **Example:** A Canadian pension fund might allocate a portion of its portfolio to high-yield bonds issued by a Canadian energy company. If the company's financial health improves, the bonds' value may increase, providing both interest income and capital gains.

3. **Distressed Securities Strategy**

   Distressed securities are the bonds or stocks of companies that are in financial trouble or near bankruptcy. Investors in distressed securities aim to purchase these assets at a significant discount, with the expectation that the company's situation will improve, leading to a substantial increase in the value of the securities.

   **Example:** An investment firm might purchase bonds from a struggling Canadian manufacturing company at a deep discount. If the company successfully restructures its operations and returns to profitability, the value of the bonds could rise significantly, resulting in substantial returns for the investor.
