## 21.10 Risk-Adjusted Return Measures

In the realm of finance, particularly within the context of alternative investments, understanding the performance of a fund or portfolio is crucial. However, evaluating performance solely based on returns can be misleading without considering the associated risks. This is where risk-adjusted return measures come into play. These metrics provide a more comprehensive view by factoring in the risk taken to achieve those returns, allowing investors to make more informed decisions.

### Importance of Risk-Adjusted Return Measures

Risk-adjusted return measures are essential tools for investors and fund managers. They help in:

- **Comparing Investments:** By adjusting for risk, investors can compare different investments on a level playing field.
- **Performance Evaluation:** These measures provide insights into how well a fund manager is performing relative to the risk taken.
- **Investment Decisions:** Investors can use these metrics to align their portfolios with their risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Key Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics

#### Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio is one of the most widely used risk-adjusted return measures. It evaluates the excess return per unit of total risk, defined as the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( R_p \\) = Portfolio return
- \\( R_f \\) = Risk-free rate
- \\( \sigma_p \\) = Standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return

**Example:**

Consider a Canadian mutual fund with an annual return of 8%, a risk-free rate of 2%, and a standard deviation of 10%. The Sharpe Ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{8\% - 2\%}{10\%} = 0.6 {{< /katex >}}

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

#### Jensen’s Alpha

Jensen’s Alpha measures the excess return of a portfolio relative to the expected return based on the portfolio’s beta, according to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \alpha = R_p - [R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f)] {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( R_p \\) = Portfolio return
- \\( R_f \\) = Risk-free rate
- \\( \beta \\) = Portfolio beta
- \\( R_m \\) = Market return

**Example:**

Assume a portfolio with a return of 10%, a beta of 1.2, a market return of 7%, and a risk-free rate of 2%. Jensen’s Alpha would be:

{{< katex >}} \alpha = 10\% - [2\% + 1.2 \times (7\% - 2\%)] = 2\% {{< /katex >}}

A positive alpha indicates that the portfolio has outperformed the market expectations.

#### Sortino Ratio

The Sortino Ratio is similar to the Sharpe Ratio but focuses only on downside risk, which is more relevant for investors concerned about negative returns.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( \sigma_d \\) = Standard deviation of the portfolio’s downside returns

**Example:**

If the downside deviation of the same fund is 8%, the Sortino Ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{8\% - 2\%}{8\%} = 0.75 {{< /katex >}}

A higher Sortino Ratio suggests better risk-adjusted performance with a focus on downside risk.

#### Calmar Ratio

The Calmar Ratio compares the average annual compounded rate of return to the maximum drawdown, providing insight into the risk of significant losses.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{CAGR}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}} {{< /katex >}}

Where:
- CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate

**Example:**

For a fund with a CAGR of 12% and a maximum drawdown of 20%, the Calmar Ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{12\%}{20\%} = 0.6 {{< /katex >}}

A higher Calmar Ratio indicates a more favorable risk-return profile.

#### Sterling Ratio

The Sterling Ratio is similar to the Calmar Ratio but includes a buffer in the denominator to account for additional risk.

**Formula:**

{{< katex >}} \text{Sterling Ratio} = \frac{\text{Average Annual Return}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown} + 10\%} {{< /katex >}}

**Example:**

Using the same fund with an average annual return of 12% and a maximum drawdown of 20%, the Sterling Ratio is:

{{< katex >}} \text{Sterling Ratio} = \frac{12\%}{20\% + 10\%} = 0.4 {{< /katex >}}

This ratio helps investors understand the return achieved per unit of risk, including a buffer for uncertainty.

### Practical Applications and Case Studies

#### Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), often use these risk-adjusted measures to evaluate their investment strategies. By focusing on long-term sustainability, they ensure that their portfolios are aligned with their risk tolerance and return objectives.

#### Major Canadian Banks

Banks like RBC and TD employ these metrics to assess their mutual fund offerings. By analyzing risk-adjusted returns, they can provide better recommendations to their clients, ensuring that investment products meet the desired risk-return profiles.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices:** Regularly review and adjust portfolios based on risk-adjusted performance metrics. Use these measures to guide strategic asset allocation and risk management decisions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Avoid relying solely on one metric. Each measure provides unique insights, and a comprehensive analysis should consider multiple metrics.

### Glossary

- **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure that indicates the average return minus the risk-free return divided by the standard deviation of return.
- **Jensen’s Alpha:** Represents the average return on a portfolio over and above that predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

### Conclusion

Risk-adjusted return measures are invaluable tools for evaluating the performance of investments, particularly in the context of alternative investments. By understanding and applying these metrics, investors can make more informed decisions, aligning their portfolios with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
