## 21.30 Benchmarking Alternative Investments

Benchmarking alternative investments is a critical process for evaluating the performance of funds that employ non-traditional investment strategies. This section delves into the intricacies of benchmarking, focusing on the selection of appropriate benchmarks, the role of benchmarking in performance assessment, and the application of these concepts within the Canadian financial context.

### Understanding Benchmarking in Alternative Investments

**Benchmarking** is the practice of comparing the performance of an investment to a standard or index. In the realm of alternative investments, which include hedge funds, private equity, real estate, and commodities, benchmarking is particularly challenging due to the diverse and complex nature of these assets. Unlike traditional investments, alternative investments often lack standardized benchmarks, making the selection process crucial for accurate performance evaluation.

### Selecting Relevant Benchmarks

The selection of a benchmark for alternative investments should align with the specific strategy and objectives of the fund. Here are key considerations in selecting relevant benchmarks:

1. **Strategy Alignment**: The benchmark must reflect the investment strategy employed by the fund. For instance, a hedge fund employing a long/short equity strategy might use a market-neutral index as a benchmark.

2. **Risk Profile**: The benchmark should have a similar risk profile to the fund. This includes volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors that might affect performance.

3. **Geographic and Sector Exposure**: Consideration of the geographic and sector exposure of the fund is essential. A Canadian real estate fund, for example, should be benchmarked against a Canadian real estate index rather than a global one.

4. **Time Horizon**: The benchmark should match the investment horizon of the fund. Long-term investments like private equity might require benchmarks that reflect longer time frames.

### Benchmarking Process

The benchmarking process involves several steps to ensure that the selected benchmark provides a meaningful comparison:

1. **Identify Potential Benchmarks**: Start by identifying a range of potential benchmarks that align with the fund's strategy and objectives.

2. **Evaluate Benchmark Characteristics**: Assess the characteristics of each benchmark, including its composition, historical performance, and risk metrics.

3. **Select the Most Appropriate Benchmark**: Choose the benchmark that best matches the fund's strategy, risk profile, and objectives.

4. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review the benchmark to ensure it remains relevant as market conditions and fund strategies evolve.

### Assessing Relative Performance

Benchmarking aids in assessing the relative performance of alternative strategy funds by providing a standard for comparison. This comparison helps investors and fund managers understand how well the fund is performing relative to its peers and the broader market. Key metrics used in performance assessment include:

- **Alpha**: Measures the fund's performance relative to the benchmark, indicating the value added by the fund manager.
- **Beta**: Assesses the fund's sensitivity to market movements, helping to understand its risk profile.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Evaluates the risk-adjusted return of the fund compared to the benchmark.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds often invest in alternative assets to diversify their portfolios and enhance returns. For instance, a pension fund with significant real estate holdings might benchmark its performance against the MSCI Canada Real Estate Index. By comparing the fund's returns to this index, the fund managers can assess whether their investment strategy is delivering superior returns relative to the market.

### Challenges in Benchmarking Alternative Investments

Benchmarking alternative investments presents several challenges:

- **Lack of Standardization**: The diverse nature of alternative investments means there is no one-size-fits-all benchmark.
- **Data Availability**: Limited historical data for certain alternative assets can complicate benchmark selection.
- **Complex Strategies**: The complexity of alternative strategies, such as derivatives or leverage, can make it difficult to find a suitable benchmark.

### Overcoming Benchmarking Challenges

To overcome these challenges, fund managers can:

- **Use Composite Benchmarks**: Combine multiple indices to create a composite benchmark that better reflects the fund's strategy.
- **Leverage Technology**: Utilize financial tools and software to analyze and compare potential benchmarks.
- **Engage Experts**: Consult with financial experts and institutions to identify the most appropriate benchmarks.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

In Canada, financial regulations and institutions play a vital role in the benchmarking process. The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) provides guidelines for performance measurement and reporting. Additionally, resources such as the "Performance Measurement and Attribution" by Robert Higgins offer valuable insights into benchmarking practices.

### Conclusion

Benchmarking alternative investments is essential for evaluating fund performance and ensuring alignment with investment objectives. By selecting relevant benchmarks and understanding the benchmarking process, investors can make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies. As the Canadian financial landscape continues to evolve, staying informed about regulatory changes and leveraging available resources will be crucial for successful benchmarking.
