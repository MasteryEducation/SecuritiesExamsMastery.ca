## 17.16 Relationship Disclosure Information

In the realm of mutual fund sales, relationship disclosure information (RDI) serves as a cornerstone for fostering transparency and trust between clients and their financial advisors. This disclosure is not merely a regulatory requirement but a fundamental practice that ensures clients are fully informed about the nature of their relationship with the dealer and representative. By providing clear and comprehensive RDI, financial professionals can help clients make informed decisions, thereby enhancing the integrity and effectiveness of financial services.

### Importance of Relationship Disclosure

Relationship disclosure is crucial in mutual fund sales as it lays the groundwork for a transparent and informed client-advisor relationship. It ensures that clients understand the scope of services provided, the nature of their accounts, and the responsibilities of both parties. This understanding is vital for building trust and confidence, which are essential for long-term client relationships and successful investment outcomes.

### Key Components of Relationship Disclosure Document

The relationship disclosure document must encompass several key components to provide a comprehensive overview of the client-advisor relationship. These components include:

#### Nature or Type of Account

The document should clearly define the type of account the client holds, outlining the client's responsibilities and the representative’s role. For instance, in a discretionary account, the advisor has the authority to make investment decisions on behalf of the client, whereas in a non-discretionary account, the client retains decision-making authority. Understanding these distinctions helps clients manage their expectations and responsibilities effectively.

#### Products and Services Offered

Clients should be informed about the range of products and services available to them. This includes whether the dealer offers only in-house mutual funds or if third-party funds are also available. Providing this information helps clients understand the breadth of investment options and the potential for diversification within their portfolios.

#### Procedures for Handling Cash and Cheques

The document must describe the procedures for handling cash and cheques, ensuring clients understand how transactions are processed. This includes details on how funds are deposited, the timeline for processing transactions, and any safeguards in place to protect client assets.

#### Dealer’s Obligations

Dealers have a fiduciary duty to ensure the suitability of their recommendations and maintain the integrity of client accounts. The relationship disclosure document should outline these obligations, emphasizing the dealer’s commitment to acting in the client’s best interest and adhering to regulatory standards.

#### Terms of Account Reporting

Clients should be informed about how and when they will receive performance reports and updates. This section of the document should specify the frequency of reports, the type of information included, and the methods of delivery, whether electronic or paper-based.

#### Disclosure of Fees

Transparency in fee disclosure is critical for maintaining trust. The document should explain how compensation is handled, including any fees paid to the dealer. This includes management fees, transaction fees, and any other charges that may apply. Clear disclosure of fees helps clients understand the cost of services and make informed decisions about their investments.

### Methods of Delivering Relationship Disclosure Information

Delivering relationship disclosure information can be accomplished through various methods, including in-person meetings, electronic communications, or mailed documents. Regardless of the method, it is essential to maintain records of the provision of RDI to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Dealers should implement robust systems for tracking and documenting the delivery of RDI, ensuring that all clients receive the necessary information in a timely manner.
