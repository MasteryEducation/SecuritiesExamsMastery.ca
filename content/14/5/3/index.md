## 17.2 Overview of Managed Products

Managed products play a pivotal role in the landscape of investment portfolios, offering investors a diverse array of options to achieve their financial goals. These products are professionally managed investment vehicles that pool funds from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. In this section, we will delve into the definition, types, and management styles of managed products, with a focus on their application within the Canadian financial market.

### Defining Managed Products

Managed products are investment vehicles that are overseen by professional managers who make decisions about how to allocate the fund's assets. These products are designed to provide investors with access to a diversified portfolio, managed by experts, which can help mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns. Managed products are essential components of many investment portfolios, offering a range of strategies and asset classes to suit different investment objectives and risk tolerances.

### Active vs. Passive Management Styles

Understanding the distinction between active and passive management styles is crucial when evaluating managed products. Each style has its own philosophy, approach, and potential benefits.

#### Active Management

Active management involves a hands-on approach where fund managers actively make investment decisions with the goal of outperforming a specific benchmark index. This style relies on the manager's expertise, research, and market insights to identify investment opportunities and make tactical adjustments to the portfolio. Active managers aim to capitalize on market inefficiencies and trends to generate superior returns.

**Example:** A Canadian equity mutual fund managed by RBC might employ active management to select stocks that the fund manager believes will outperform the S&P/TSX Composite Index.

#### Passive Management

In contrast, passive management seeks to replicate the performance of a specific benchmark index. This style involves constructing a portfolio that mirrors the index's composition, with minimal trading and lower management fees. Passive management is based on the belief that markets are efficient and that it is challenging to consistently outperform the index.

**Example:** A Canadian ETF that tracks the S&P/TSX 60 Index would use passive management to maintain a portfolio that closely matches the index's holdings.

### Types of Managed Products

The Canadian market offers a wide variety of managed products, each catering to different investment needs and preferences. Below, we explore some of the most common types:

#### Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are one of the most popular managed products, pooling money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. They offer liquidity, professional management, and diversification, making them accessible to a broad range of investors.

#### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They typically follow a passive management style, tracking a specific index. ETFs offer flexibility, tax efficiency, and lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.

#### Segregated Funds

Segregated funds are insurance products that combine investment and insurance features. Offered by Canadian insurance companies, they provide a guarantee on a portion of the invested capital at maturity or death, offering a level of protection not found in mutual funds.

#### Liquid Alternatives

Liquid alternatives are mutual funds or ETFs that employ alternative investment strategies, such as short selling, leverage, or derivatives, to achieve their investment objectives. They offer retail investors access to strategies traditionally reserved for hedge funds.

#### Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are private investment funds that use a range of strategies to generate returns, including leveraging, short selling, and derivatives. They are typically available to accredited investors and offer the potential for high returns, albeit with higher risk.

#### Listed Private Equity Funds

These funds invest in private companies or provide capital for buyouts, offering investors exposure to private equity markets. They are listed on stock exchanges, providing liquidity that is not typically available in traditional private equity investments.

#### Closed-End Funds

Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares and trade on stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, they do not issue or redeem shares on demand. Their market price can differ from their net asset value (NAV), offering opportunities for investors to buy at a discount or sell at a premium.

#### Labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCCs)

LSVCCs are unique to Canada, providing venture capital to small and medium-sized enterprises. They offer tax credits to investors, encouraging investment in Canadian businesses and fostering economic growth.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Investors in managed products must navigate a complex regulatory environment. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) provide oversight and guidance to ensure transparency and protect investors. For more information, visit the [CSA Website](https://www.securities-administrators.ca).

#### Recommended Reading

- "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" by Philip Fisher

### Practical Application and Considerations

When incorporating managed products into your investment portfolio, consider the following best practices:

- **Diversification:** Use a mix of managed products to diversify across asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions.
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment goals to select products that align with your financial objectives.
- **Cost Analysis:** Compare management fees and expense ratios to ensure you are getting value for your investment.
- **Performance Review:** Regularly review the performance of your managed products against their benchmarks and make adjustments as needed.

### Conclusion

Managed products offer a versatile and professionally managed approach to investing, catering to a wide range of investor needs. By understanding the different types and management styles, investors can make informed decisions to optimize their portfolios. As you explore managed products, consider the regulatory landscape and leverage available resources to enhance your investment strategy.
