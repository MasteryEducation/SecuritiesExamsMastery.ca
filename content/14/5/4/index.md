## 17.3 Advantages of Managed Products

Managed products, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and labour-sponsored venture capital corporations (LSVCCs), offer a range of advantages that make them attractive to both novice and experienced investors. These products are designed to pool resources from multiple investors to achieve specific investment objectives, managed by professional fund managers. In this section, we will explore the key benefits of investing in managed products, focusing on professional management, economies of scale, low-cost diversification, liquidity and flexibility, tax benefits, and access to specialized funds.

### Professional Management

One of the primary advantages of managed products is access to professional management. Investment managers bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the table, making informed decisions on behalf of investors. These professionals conduct thorough research, analyze market trends, and adjust portfolios to optimize returns while managing risk.

For example, consider a Canadian mutual fund managed by a team at a major bank like RBC or TD. These managers have access to extensive resources and data, allowing them to make strategic decisions that individual investors might not be able to achieve on their own. This professional oversight can be particularly beneficial in volatile markets, where timely and informed decisions are crucial.

### Economies of Scale

Managed products benefit from economies of scale, which can lead to lower fees and transaction costs. When investments are pooled together, the cost of managing the fund is spread across a larger asset base, reducing the per-unit cost for each investor. This is particularly advantageous for smaller investors who might otherwise face higher fees if investing independently.

For instance, a mutual fund with a large asset base can negotiate better terms with brokers and other service providers, passing these savings onto investors. This cost efficiency is a significant draw for those looking to maximize their investment returns.

### Low-Cost Diversification

Diversification is a fundamental principle of investing, aimed at reducing risk by spreading investments across various asset classes. Managed products offer low-cost diversification, allowing investors to achieve a diversified portfolio even with a small amount of capital.

A Canadian investor with limited funds can invest in a mutual fund that holds a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities. This diversification helps mitigate the risk associated with any single investment, as losses in one area can be offset by gains in another. Managed products make it easy for investors to access a broad range of assets without the need to purchase each one individually.

### Liquidity and Flexibility

Managed products, particularly mutual funds and ETFs, offer liquidity and flexibility, making it easy for investors to buy and sell units. This liquidity is crucial for investors who may need to access their funds quickly or adjust their investment strategy in response to changing market conditions.

For example, mutual funds are typically priced at the end of each trading day, allowing investors to redeem their shares at the net asset value (NAV). ETFs, on the other hand, trade on stock exchanges throughout the day, providing even greater flexibility for those who wish to trade more actively.

### Tax Benefits

Certain managed products offer tax advantages that can enhance overall returns. In Canada, labour-sponsored venture capital corporations (LSVCCs) provide tax credits to investors, encouraging investment in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

These tax benefits can be a compelling reason for investors to include managed products in their portfolios, as they can reduce the overall tax burden and improve net returns. However, it's important for investors to understand the specific tax implications of each product and consult with a tax advisor if necessary.

### Access to Specialized Funds

Managed products provide access to specialized funds that focus on niche markets or specific asset classes. This access allows investors to tailor their portfolios to align with their investment goals and risk tolerance.

For instance, an investor interested in sustainable investing can choose a mutual fund that focuses on environmentally responsible companies. Similarly, those looking to invest in emerging markets can select a fund that targets these regions, gaining exposure to opportunities that might be difficult to access independently.
