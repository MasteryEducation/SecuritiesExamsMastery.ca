## 13.12 Classifying Industries by Product or Service

In the realm of finance and investment, understanding how industries are classified is crucial for analyzing market trends, making informed investment decisions, and constructing diversified portfolios. One of the most widely used frameworks for industry classification is the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI. This section delves into the intricacies of classifying industries by the products or services they offer, with a particular focus on the GICS framework.

### Understanding Industry Classification

Industry classification involves categorizing companies based on the primary products or services they provide. This classification helps investors and analysts compare companies within the same industry, assess industry performance, and identify trends. By grouping companies with similar business activities, industry classification systems facilitate a structured approach to market analysis.

### Introduction to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)

The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) is a comprehensive, standardized classification system used globally to categorize companies into sectors and industries. Developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI, GICS is widely adopted by financial professionals, including portfolio managers, analysts, and researchers, to streamline the investment process.

#### Key Features of GICS

- **Standardization:** GICS provides a consistent framework for classifying companies, enabling comparability across different markets and regions.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** GICS organizes companies into a four-tiered hierarchy: sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries.
- **Global Applicability:** GICS is used by financial markets worldwide, making it a universal language for industry classification.

### The Hierarchical Structure of GICS

The GICS framework is structured hierarchically, allowing for detailed analysis at various levels of granularity. This structure consists of four levels:

1. **Sectors:** The broadest level, consisting of 11 sectors that represent major areas of the economy. Examples include Information Technology, Healthcare, and Financials.

2. **Industry Groups:** Each sector is divided into industry groups, which provide a more specific categorization. For instance, the Financials sector includes industry groups such as Banks and Insurance.

3. **Industries:** Industry groups are further divided into industries, offering even more specificity. Within the Banks industry group, for example, there are industries like Diversified Banks and Regional Banks.

4. **Sub-Industries:** The most granular level, sub-industries, allows for detailed analysis of specific business activities. For example, within the Diversified Banks industry, there might be sub-industries focusing on different banking services.

#### Visual Representation of GICS Hierarchy

### Practical Application of GICS in Investment

GICS is instrumental in portfolio management and investment analysis. By classifying companies into sectors and industries, investors can:

- **Diversify Portfolios:** Allocate investments across different sectors to mitigate risk.
- **Conduct Sector Analysis:** Evaluate the performance of specific sectors to identify growth opportunities.
- **Benchmark Performance:** Compare a company's performance against its industry peers.

#### Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), utilize GICS to diversify their investments across various sectors. By analyzing sector performance, these funds can adjust their asset allocation to optimize returns while managing risk.
