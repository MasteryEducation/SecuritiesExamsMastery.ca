## 13.23 Review Questions

Chapter 13 of the CSC® Exam Prep Guide: Volume 2 delves into the intricacies of fundamental and technical analysis, two critical approaches for evaluating securities and making informed investment decisions. This section provides a comprehensive set of review questions designed to test your understanding of these concepts and encourage the application of knowledge through practical scenarios. 

### Understanding Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis involves evaluating a company's financial statements, management, competitive advantages, and market conditions to determine its intrinsic value. This approach is grounded in the belief that a security's market price will eventually reflect its true value.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Financial Statements**: Balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.
- **Ratios**: Price-to-earnings (P/E), return on equity (ROE), and debt-to-equity ratios.
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation.
- **Qualitative Factors**: Management quality, brand strength, and industry position.

### Understanding Technical Analysis

Technical analysis focuses on statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. It is based on the idea that historical trading activity and price changes can be valuable indicators of future price movements.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Charts**: Line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts.
- **Indicators**: Moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and MACD.
- **Patterns**: Head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, and triangles.
- **Volume Analysis**: Understanding the significance of trading volume in confirming trends.

### Application of Concepts

To effectively apply these analytical methods, consider hypothetical scenarios that challenge your ability to interpret data and make investment decisions. For example, analyze a Canadian company's financial statements to assess its investment potential or use technical indicators to predict future stock price movements.

### Online Resources

For additional practice, the Canadian Securities Institute offers online quizzes and practice tests that can further enhance your understanding and readiness for the CSC® exam. These resources provide a valuable opportunity to apply your knowledge in a simulated exam environment.
