## Glossary for Chapter 23

Chapter 23 of the CSC® Exam Prep Guide: Volume 2 delves into the intricate world of structured products, a vital component of modern investment portfolios. This glossary serves as a comprehensive reference to the key terms and concepts discussed in the chapter, providing clarity and depth to readers seeking to enhance their understanding of these complex financial instruments. Whether you're a seasoned finance professional or a student preparing for the CSC® exam, this glossary will aid in navigating the nuances of structured products and related investment vehicles.

### Structured Product
A structured product is a pre-packaged investment strategy that typically involves derivatives to achieve specific risk-return profiles. These products are designed to meet the needs of investors by offering tailored exposure to various asset classes, often with features like capital protection or enhanced returns. For example, a structured product might combine a zero-coupon bond with an option on a stock index to provide principal protection while allowing for participation in equity market gains.

### Principal-Protected Note (PPN)
A Principal-Protected Note is an investment that guarantees the return of the initial investment amount at maturity, regardless of the performance of the underlying assets. PPNs are attractive to risk-averse investors who seek exposure to potential upside without risking their principal. For instance, a PPN linked to the S&P/TSX Composite Index would return the initial investment plus any gains from the index's performance over the investment period.

### Market-Linked Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC)
A Market-Linked GIC is a type of GIC that provides returns based on the performance of an underlying market index or asset. Unlike traditional GICs with fixed interest rates, market-linked GICs offer the potential for higher returns tied to market performance while maintaining principal protection. An example is a GIC linked to the performance of the Canadian banking sector, offering returns based on the sector's growth.

### Split Share
Split shares are securities that separate the investment attributes of an underlying portfolio into preferred and capital share components. This structure allows investors to choose between income-focused preferred shares and growth-oriented capital shares. For example, a split share corporation might hold a portfolio of Canadian blue-chip stocks, offering preferred shares with fixed dividends and capital shares with potential for capital appreciation.

### Asset-Backed Security (ABS)
An Asset-Backed Security is a financial instrument backed by a pool of assets, such as loans or receivables, which generate cash flows. ABSs provide investors with exposure to asset pools like auto loans, credit card receivables, or student loans, offering diversification and potential yield enhancement. A Canadian example is an ABS backed by a pool of residential mortgages.

### Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper is a short-term ABS with maturities typically less than one year, used for financing asset pools. ABCP is often issued by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and provides liquidity to the underlying asset pools. In Canada, ABCP played a significant role in the financial markets before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, highlighting the importance of understanding the risks involved.

### Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)
A Mortgage-Backed Security is an ABS backed by a pool of mortgage loans, offering regular income from mortgage payments. MBSs are popular among investors seeking steady cash flows and exposure to the real estate market. In Canada, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) plays a key role in the MBS market by guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities.

### Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
A Special Purpose Vehicle is a subsidiary created to isolate financial risk and hold securitized assets separately from the parent company. SPVs are crucial in structured finance, allowing companies to offload risk and manage financial exposure. For example, a Canadian bank might use an SPV to issue asset-backed securities without affecting its balance sheet.

### Tranche
A tranche is a segment of an ABS with specific risk and reward characteristics, catering to different investor needs. Tranches allow investors to choose their desired level of risk and return, with senior tranches offering lower risk and returns, and junior tranches offering higher risk and potential returns. This structure is common in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.

### Zero-Coupon Bond
A Zero-Coupon Bond is a bond that does not pay periodic interest but is issued at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity. Investors in zero-coupon bonds benefit from the difference between the purchase price and the maturity value, making them attractive for long-term investment strategies. In Canada, zero-coupon bonds are often used in tax-advantaged accounts like RRSPs.

### Participation Rate
The participation rate is the percentage of the underlying index’s return that is credited to the investor in structured products. This rate determines the extent to which investors benefit from the performance of the underlying assets. For example, a structured product with a 70% participation rate in the TSX index would credit 70% of the index's gains to the investor.

### Prepayment Risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that borrowers will repay their loans earlier than expected, impacting the cash flows of securitized products. This risk is particularly relevant for mortgage-backed securities, where falling interest rates may lead to increased mortgage prepayments. Investors must consider prepayment risk when evaluating the potential returns of ABSs and MBSs.

### Credit Quality
Credit quality is an assessment of the creditworthiness of an issuer or underlying assets, influencing the risk and return of securities. High credit quality indicates lower risk and typically lower returns, while lower credit quality suggests higher risk and potential returns. In Canada, credit ratings agencies like DBRS Morningstar provide credit assessments for various securities.

### Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to buy or sell an investment quickly without a significant price concession. This risk is particularly relevant for structured products and less liquid securities, where market conditions can impact the ability to execute trades at desired prices. Investors should assess liquidity risk when constructing portfolios, especially in volatile markets.

### Tracking Error
Tracking error is the deviation of a structured product's performance from its benchmark index or underlying asset. This measure is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of investment strategies, particularly for ETFs and index-linked products. A low tracking error indicates that the product closely follows its benchmark, while a high tracking error suggests significant deviations.

### Roll Yield Loss
Roll yield loss is the loss incurred when rolling over futures contracts from a near-term to a longer-term contract in a contango market. This phenomenon occurs when the futures price is higher than the expected future spot price, leading to negative returns when contracts are rolled over. Investors in futures-based ETFs and structured products must consider roll yield loss when evaluating potential returns.

### Counterparty Risk
Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party in a financial contract will default on their obligations. This risk is inherent in derivatives and structured products, where the performance depends on the counterparty's ability to fulfill its commitments. In Canada, regulatory frameworks aim to mitigate counterparty risk through measures like collateral requirements and clearinghouses.

### Tranching
Tranching is the process of dividing a securitized product into different layers or tranches, each with its own risk and return profile. This structure allows issuers to cater to diverse investor preferences, offering a range of risk-return combinations. Tranching is common in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations, providing flexibility in investment strategies.

### Capital Share
The capital share is the component of a split share that receives capital gains after preferred shares have been paid dividends. Capital shares are suitable for investors seeking growth potential, as they benefit from the appreciation of the underlying portfolio. In Canada, split share corporations often issue capital shares to attract growth-oriented investors.

### Preferred Share
The preferred share is the component of a split share that receives dividends and has priority claims on assets over capital shares. Preferred shares are ideal for income-focused investors, offering fixed dividends and lower risk compared to capital shares. Canadian investors often include preferred shares in their portfolios for stable income and diversification.

### Roll Yield
Roll yield is the yield gained or lost from rolling over futures contracts as they expire. This yield is a critical factor in the performance of futures-based ETFs and structured products, influencing returns based on market conditions. Positive roll yield occurs in backwardation markets, while negative roll yield is common in contango markets.

### Debt Risk
Debt risk is the risk associated with the issuer’s ability to repay the principal and interest on debt securities. This risk is a key consideration for investors in bonds and structured products, where the issuer's financial health impacts the likelihood of default. In Canada, debt risk assessments are provided by credit rating agencies, guiding investment decisions.

### Securitization
Securitization is the process of pooling financial assets and selling their cash flows to third-party investors as securities. This process transforms illiquid assets into tradable securities, providing liquidity and diversification benefits. In Canada, securitization is commonly used for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card receivables, enhancing the efficiency of financial markets.

### In-Kind Exchange
In-kind exchange is the process where ETF or structured product units are exchanged for underlying securities without using cash. This mechanism is crucial for the creation and redemption of ETF units, allowing for efficient portfolio management and tax advantages. Canadian investors benefit from in-kind exchanges by minimizing capital gains taxes and transaction costs.

### Yield-To-Call
Yield-to-call is the rate of return on a bond or structured product if it is held until the call date, assuming it is called. This measure is important for callable securities, where issuers have the option to redeem the security before maturity. Investors in Canada must consider yield-to-call when evaluating the potential returns of callable bonds and structured products.

### Superficial Loss
A superficial loss is a term related to tax loss harvesting strategies that involve selling securities at a loss but rebuying similar securities within a short period. In Canada, the superficial loss rule disallows the deduction of capital losses if the same or identical securities are repurchased within 30 days. Investors must be aware of this rule when implementing tax-efficient investment strategies.

### Other Terms Mentioned in the Chapter

#### Active ETF
An Active ETF is an ETF that is actively managed to outperform its benchmark index. Unlike passive ETFs, active ETFs involve portfolio managers making investment decisions to achieve superior returns. In Canada, active ETFs are gaining popularity as investors seek alpha generation and risk management.

An Inverse ETF is an ETF designed to deliver the opposite performance of a specific index. These ETFs are used by investors to hedge against market downturns or profit from declining markets. In Canada, inverse ETFs provide a tool for tactical asset allocation and risk management.

#### Core Holdings
Core holdings are the foundational investments in a portfolio, often passive and diversified. These holdings provide stability and long-term growth potential, forming the backbone of a well-constructed investment strategy. Canadian investors typically include broad market ETFs and blue-chip stocks as core holdings.

#### Leveraged ETF
A Leveraged ETF is an ETF that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. These ETFs offer magnified exposure to market movements, appealing to investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. In Canada, leveraged ETFs are used for short-term trading and speculative strategies.

#### Commodity ETF
A Commodity ETF is an ETF that invests in commodities such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. These ETFs provide exposure to commodity markets, offering diversification and inflation protection. Canadian investors often use commodity ETFs to hedge against currency fluctuations and economic cycles.

#### Physical-Based ETF
A Physical-Based ETF is an ETF that holds the actual underlying assets, such as gold bullion. These ETFs provide direct exposure to the physical commodity, offering transparency and security. In Canada, physical-based ETFs are popular for precious metals investments, providing a tangible asset backing.

#### Covered Call ETF
A Covered Call ETF is an ETF that employs a covered call options strategy to enhance income and reduce volatility. This strategy involves writing call options on the underlying assets, generating premium income while maintaining exposure to the asset. Canadian investors use covered call ETFs for income generation and risk management.

#### Prescribed Number of Units
The prescribed number of units is the standardized block size of units exchanged in the creation/redemption process of ETFs. This standardization ensures efficient trading and liquidity in the ETF market. In Canada, the prescribed number of units facilitates the smooth operation of ETF transactions and market making.

#### Designated Broker
A designated broker is a broker assigned to facilitate the creation and redemption of ETF units. These brokers play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and market efficiency, ensuring that ETFs trade close to their net asset value. In Canada, designated brokers are essential for the functioning of the ETF ecosystem.

#### Equity-Based ETF
An Equity-Based ETF is an ETF that primarily invests in equities or stock-based indexes. These ETFs provide exposure to equity markets, offering growth potential and diversification. Canadian investors use equity-based ETFs to gain access to domestic and international stock markets.

#### Rules-Based ETF
A Rules-Based ETF is an ETF that follows a specific set of rules or criteria, often part of smart beta strategies. These ETFs aim to outperform traditional market-cap-weighted indexes by employing alternative weighting schemes or factor-based approaches. In Canada, rules-based ETFs are used for strategic asset allocation and risk management.

#### ETF Facts
ETF Facts is a summary disclosure document similar to mutual fund facts, detailing key features and risks of an ETF. This document provides investors with essential information about the ETF's investment objectives, fees, and performance. In Canada, ETF Facts are mandated by regulators to ensure transparency and informed decision-making.

#### Sampling
Sampling is a method used in ETF portfolio construction where a representative sample of securities is held instead of the entire index. This approach reduces transaction costs and enhances liquidity while maintaining index-like performance. Canadian ETFs often use sampling to efficiently track broad market indexes.

#### Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)
Exchange-Traded Notes are debt securities issued by banks that track the performance of a market index or benchmark, differing from ETFs in structure and risk. ETNs provide exposure to various asset classes, offering diversification and potential tax advantages. In Canada, ETNs are used for accessing niche markets and alternative investment strategies.

#### Spot Price
The spot price is the current market price at which an asset is bought or sold for immediate payment and delivery. This price is crucial for pricing derivatives and structured products, reflecting the asset's real-time value. In Canada, spot prices are used for commodities, currencies, and other financial instruments.

#### Full Replication
Full replication is an ETF strategy that involves holding all the securities in the underlying index in the exact proportions. This approach ensures precise tracking of the index, minimizing tracking error. Canadian ETFs often use full replication for large, liquid indexes to provide accurate exposure and performance.

#### Synthetic ETF
A Synthetic ETF is an ETF that uses derivatives to replicate the performance of an index without holding the actual underlying securities. This approach allows for cost-effective exposure to hard-to-access markets or assets. In Canada, synthetic ETFs are used for gaining exposure to international markets and complex investment strategies.
