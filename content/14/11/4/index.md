## 23.3 Disadvantages and Risks of Structured Products

Structured products are complex financial instruments that combine derivatives with traditional securities like bonds or equities. While they offer unique investment opportunities, they also come with a range of disadvantages and risks that investors must carefully consider. This section delves into these challenges, providing insights into the potential pitfalls associated with structured products, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Complexity and Understanding Challenges

One of the primary disadvantages of structured products is their inherent complexity. These instruments often involve intricate combinations of derivatives and other financial components, making them difficult for the average investor to fully understand. This complexity can lead to misunderstandings about how the product works, its potential returns, and the risks involved.

For example, a structured product might promise returns linked to the performance of a specific index, but the actual payout could depend on a variety of factors, including interest rate movements, market volatility, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. This complexity requires investors to have a deep understanding of financial markets and derivative instruments, which can be a significant barrier for many.

### High Fees and Embedded Costs

Structured products often come with high fees and embedded costs that can significantly erode potential returns. These costs can include management fees, distribution fees, and costs associated with the derivatives used in the product's structure. Unlike traditional investments, where fees are often transparent, the costs associated with structured products can be hidden within the product's pricing, making them difficult for investors to identify and evaluate.

For instance, a structured product offered by a major Canadian bank might have a seemingly attractive return profile, but once the fees are accounted for, the net return could be substantially lower than anticipated. Investors need to carefully scrutinize the fee structure of any structured product to ensure that the potential returns justify the costs.

### Liquidity Risks

Liquidity risk is another significant concern with structured products. Many of these instruments are not traded on secondary markets, meaning that investors may find it challenging to sell them before maturity. This lack of liquidity can be particularly problematic if an investor needs to access their funds quickly or if market conditions change unfavorably.

In Canada, the secondary market for structured products is often thin or non-existent, which can lead to significant price concessions if an investor needs to sell their position. This illiquidity can result in substantial losses, especially in volatile market conditions where the demand for such products is low.

### Credit Risk of Issuing Institutions

Structured products are typically issued by financial institutions, and their value is directly linked to the creditworthiness of the issuer. This introduces credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer may default on its financial obligations. If the issuing institution faces financial difficulties or becomes insolvent, investors may lose some or all of their investment.

For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, several financial institutions faced severe credit issues, leading to significant losses for investors holding structured products issued by those institutions. In Canada, while major banks like RBC and TD are generally considered stable, investors must still assess the credit risk associated with any structured product issuer.

### Tracking Error Risks

Tracking error risk refers to the potential for a structured product's performance to deviate from its underlying asset or benchmark index. This can occur due to various factors, including the product's structure, market conditions, and the performance of the derivatives used within the product.

For instance, a structured product designed to track the S&P/TSX Composite Index might underperform the index due to tracking errors. These discrepancies can arise from the costs of managing the product, changes in market conditions, or the specific terms of the derivatives used. Investors need to be aware of the potential for tracking errors and understand how they might impact the product's overall performance.

### Best Practices and Mitigation Strategies

To navigate the disadvantages and risks associated with structured products, investors should consider the following best practices:

1. **Thorough Research:** Conduct comprehensive research on the structured product, including its structure, fees, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. Utilize resources such as the CFA Institute's [Risks in Structured Products](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/foundation/2018/risks-structured-products) for additional insights.

2. **Professional Advice:** Seek advice from financial professionals who have experience with structured products. They can provide valuable insights into the product's risks and potential returns.

3. **Diversification:** Avoid concentrating too much of your portfolio in structured products. Diversification can help mitigate the risks associated with these complex instruments.

4. **Understanding Terms and Conditions:** Carefully read and understand the terms and conditions of the structured product, including any potential scenarios that could impact returns.

5. **Monitoring Market Conditions:** Stay informed about market conditions and how they might affect the performance of structured products. This includes monitoring interest rates, credit ratings of issuers, and overall market volatility.

### Conclusion

Structured products offer unique investment opportunities but come with significant disadvantages and risks that require careful consideration. By understanding the complexities, fees, liquidity issues, credit risks, and tracking errors associated with these instruments, investors can make more informed decisions and better manage their investment portfolios. As always, continuous learning and staying informed about market developments are crucial for successful investing.
