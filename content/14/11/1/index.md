## Overview of Chapter 23: Structured Products

Structured products have become an integral part of modern investment strategies, offering tailored solutions that cater to specific risk-return profiles. This chapter delves into the intricacies of structured products, highlighting their purpose, benefits, and associated risks. We will explore various types of structured products, such as principal-protected notes, market-linked GICs, split shares, asset-backed securities, asset-backed commercial paper, and mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, the chapter will cover the securitization process, tax implications, and specific risks related to these products.

### Introduction to Structured Products

Structured products are pre-packaged investment strategies that combine traditional financial instruments with derivatives to achieve specific investment objectives. These products are designed to offer customized risk-return profiles, making them attractive to investors seeking tailored solutions. In Canada, structured products are increasingly popular among retail and institutional investors due to their potential for enhanced returns and risk management.

### Benefits and Risks of Structured Products

#### Benefits

1. **Customization:** Structured products can be tailored to meet specific investment goals, such as capital preservation, income generation, or growth.
2. **Principal Protection:** Many structured products offer principal protection, ensuring the return of the initial investment at maturity, regardless of market performance.
3. **Diversification:** By combining different asset classes and derivatives, structured products provide diversification benefits, reducing overall portfolio risk.
4. **Enhanced Returns:** Structured products can offer higher returns compared to traditional investments by leveraging derivatives and market-linked performance.

#### Risks

1. **Complexity:** The intricate nature of structured products can make them difficult to understand, leading to potential misinterpretation of risks and returns.
2. **Liquidity Risk:** Some structured products may have limited liquidity, making it challenging to sell them before maturity.
3. **Credit Risk:** The issuer's creditworthiness can impact the product's performance, especially in the case of principal-protected notes.
4. **Market Risk:** Structured products linked to market performance are subject to market volatility, which can affect returns.

### Types of Structured Products

#### Principal-Protected Notes (PPNs)

Principal-protected notes are structured products that guarantee the return of the initial investment at maturity. They are linked to the performance of underlying assets, such as equities or indices, offering potential upside without risking the principal. PPNs are ideal for risk-averse investors seeking exposure to market growth while preserving capital.

#### Market-Linked GICs

Market-linked Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) are similar to traditional GICs but offer returns linked to the performance of specific market indices. These products provide a combination of principal protection and market participation, making them suitable for conservative investors looking for higher returns than standard GICs.

#### Split Shares

Split shares are structured products that divide the returns of an underlying portfolio into two distinct components: capital shares and preferred shares. Capital shares offer potential for capital appreciation, while preferred shares provide fixed income. Split shares are popular among investors seeking targeted exposure to growth or income.

#### Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)

Asset-backed securities are created through the securitization process, where financial assets such as loans or receivables are pooled and sold to investors as securities. ABS provide liquidity and risk distribution, making them attractive to investors seeking exposure to diversified asset pools.

#### Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)

Asset-backed commercial paper is a short-term investment vehicle backed by financial assets. ABCP offers higher yields compared to traditional commercial paper, but it carries liquidity and credit risks. Investors should carefully assess the underlying assets and issuer's creditworthiness before investing.

#### Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

Mortgage-backed securities are a type of ABS backed by mortgage loans. MBS provide investors with exposure to the real estate market and offer regular income through mortgage payments. However, they are subject to prepayment and interest rate risks, which can impact returns.

### The Securitization Process

Securitization is the process of transforming illiquid assets into tradable securities, enhancing liquidity and risk distribution. This process involves pooling financial assets, such as loans or receivables, and selling their related cash flows to third-party investors. Securitization plays a crucial role in creating asset-backed securities, providing investors with diversified exposure to various asset classes.

### Tax Implications and Specific Risks

Structured products have unique tax implications that investors must consider. For instance, the income generated from structured products may be taxed differently depending on the product type and underlying assets. Investors should consult with tax professionals to understand the tax treatment of their investments.

Specific risks associated with structured products include:

- **Interest Rate Risk:** Changes in interest rates can affect the value of structured products, particularly those with fixed income components.
- **Prepayment Risk:** For products like mortgage-backed securities, borrowers may repay loans earlier than expected, impacting cash flows and returns.
- **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in regulations can affect the issuance and performance of structured products.
