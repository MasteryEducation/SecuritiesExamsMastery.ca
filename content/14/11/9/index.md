## 23.8 Asset-Backed Commercial Paper and Mortgage-Backed Securities

In the realm of structured finance, Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) stand out as pivotal instruments. These financial products are designed to provide liquidity and investment opportunities by securitizing various types of assets. Understanding their structures, risks, and roles within the Canadian financial landscape is crucial for finance professionals and investors alike.

### Defining Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

**Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)** is a type of short-term investment vehicle with maturities typically less than one year. It is backed by a pool of assets, such as trade receivables, auto loans, or credit card debt. ABCP is issued by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or conduit, which purchases these assets and finances them through the issuance of commercial paper.

**Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**, on the other hand, are a type of asset-backed security that is backed by a pool of mortgage loans. Investors in MBS receive periodic payments derived from the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the underlying mortgages.

### Structures, Similarities, and Differences

Both ABCP and MBS are forms of asset-backed securities (ABS), but they differ in terms of structure and underlying assets.

- **Structure:**
  - **ABCP** is typically structured as a short-term debt instrument, with the underlying assets being various types of receivables or loans. The SPV issues the commercial paper to investors and uses the proceeds to purchase the assets.
  - **MBS** involves pooling mortgage loans and issuing securities that entitle investors to cash flows from the mortgage payments. The structure can vary, including pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).

- **Similarities:**
  - Both are securitized products, meaning they transform illiquid assets into tradable securities.
  - They provide liquidity to the originators by allowing them to offload assets from their balance sheets.

- **Differences:**
  - The primary difference lies in the type of underlying assets: ABCP is backed by short-term receivables, while MBS is backed by long-term mortgage loans.
  - MBS often involves more complex structures and longer maturities compared to ABCP.

### Roles of Originators and Issuers

**Originators** are entities that generate the underlying assets. For ABCP, originators could be companies with receivables, while for MBS, they are typically mortgage lenders. These originators sell the assets to an SPV, which then issues the securities.

**Issuers** are responsible for creating and selling the securities to investors. They manage the SPV and ensure that the cash flows from the underlying assets are distributed to investors.

### Risks Associated with ABCP

ABCP carries several risks, including:

- **Roll-over Risk:** This is the risk that the issuer will not be able to refinance maturing ABCP. If investors are unwilling to purchase new paper, the issuer may face liquidity issues.
- **Credit Risk:** The risk that the underlying assets will default, affecting the ability of the SPV to meet its obligations to investors.

### Features and Risks of MBS

MBS has its own set of features and risks:

- **Prepayment Risk:** Borrowers may repay their mortgages earlier than expected, especially in a declining interest rate environment. This can lead to variability in the cash flows received by investors.
- **Credit Quality Guarantees:** In Canada, many MBS are guaranteed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), which enhances their credit quality and provides a level of security to investors.

### The Canadian ABCP Crisis: Lessons Learned

The Canadian ABCP crisis of 2007-2008 highlighted significant issues related to transparency and credit risk. Many investors were unaware of the true nature and risk of the underlying assets, leading to a loss of confidence and a freeze in the market. The crisis underscored the importance of transparency, proper risk assessment, and the need for regulatory oversight.

### Glossary
