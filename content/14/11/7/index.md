## 23.6 Split Shares

Split shares are a unique type of structured financial product that divides the investment attributes of underlying equities into two distinct components: preferred shares and capital shares. This division allows investors to choose between income-focused or growth-focused investment strategies, depending on their risk tolerance and financial goals. In this section, we will delve into the mechanics of split shares, explore the benefits and risks associated with them, and provide practical examples to illustrate their application in the Canadian financial market.

### Understanding the Mechanism of Split Shares

Split shares are created by a split share corporation, which holds a portfolio of underlying equities. This corporation issues two types of shares: preferred shares and capital shares. Each type of share has distinct characteristics and appeals to different types of investors.

#### Preferred Shares

Preferred shares in a split share structure are designed to provide a steady income stream. They receive prioritized dividends, which are typically fixed and paid out before any distributions to capital shares. Additionally, preferred shares have priority in claims on the corporation's assets in the event of liquidation. This makes them a relatively safer investment compared to capital shares, as they offer more predictable returns and lower risk.

#### Capital Shares

Capital shares, on the other hand, are designed for investors seeking capital appreciation. These shares do not receive dividends; instead, they are entitled to the capital gains generated by the underlying portfolio after the preferred shares' dividend obligations are met. Capital shares carry higher risk, as their value is directly tied to the performance of the underlying equities. This makes them more volatile and susceptible to market fluctuations, but they also offer the potential for higher returns.

### Leveraged Nature of Capital Shares

One of the key features of capital shares is their leveraged nature. Because capital shares do not receive dividends, their value is more sensitive to changes in the price of the underlying equities. This leverage can amplify both gains and losses, making capital shares a high-risk, high-reward investment.

#### Example: Leveraged Impact on Capital Shares

Consider a split share corporation that holds a portfolio of Canadian bank stocks. If the value of these stocks increases by 10%, the capital shares may experience a much larger percentage increase in value due to their leveraged nature. Conversely, if the stock value decreases by 10%, the capital shares may suffer a more significant percentage loss.

### Risks Associated with Split Shares

While split shares offer unique investment opportunities, they also come with inherent risks that investors must consider.

#### Inherent Leverage

As discussed, capital shares are inherently leveraged, which can lead to significant volatility. Investors in capital shares must be prepared for substantial fluctuations in value and the possibility of losing their entire investment if the underlying equities perform poorly.

#### Volatility

The volatility of split shares is primarily driven by the performance of the underlying equities. Market conditions, economic factors, and company-specific events can all impact the value of split shares, making them a less stable investment compared to traditional equities.

#### Dividend Cuts

For preferred shares, the risk of dividend cuts is a critical consideration. If the underlying equities do not generate sufficient income, the split share corporation may be unable to meet its dividend obligations, leading to reduced or suspended payments to preferred shareholders.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To better understand the application of split shares in the Canadian market, let's explore a real-world example involving a major Canadian bank.

#### Case Study: RBC Split Share Corporation

The RBC Split Share Corporation is a well-known example of a split share structure in Canada. It holds a diversified portfolio of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) stocks and issues both preferred and capital shares. Investors in the preferred shares receive regular dividend payments, while those holding capital shares benefit from any capital appreciation of the RBC stocks.

This structure allows investors to tailor their investment strategy based on their risk tolerance and income needs. For instance, a retiree seeking stable income might invest in the preferred shares, while a younger investor with a higher risk appetite might choose the capital shares for potential growth.

### Regulatory Considerations and Resources

Investors interested in split shares should be aware of the regulatory framework governing these products in Canada. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) provide guidelines and oversight to ensure transparency and investor protection.

### Conclusion

Split shares offer a unique investment opportunity by dividing the attributes of underlying equities into preferred and capital shares. While they provide flexibility and potential for tailored investment strategies, they also come with inherent risks, particularly for capital shares. Understanding the mechanics, risks, and regulatory considerations of split shares is crucial for investors looking to incorporate them into their portfolios.
