## 24.17 Making Loans

In the realm of Canadian taxation, making loans within a family can serve as a strategic tool for tax efficiency and wealth transfer. This section delves into the intricacies of using formal loans to transfer funds within a family, ensuring compliance with tax regulations and maximizing financial benefits.

### Overview of Family Loans as a Tax-Efficient Strategy

Family loans, when structured correctly, can be an effective method for transferring wealth while minimizing tax liabilities. By lending money from a higher-income family member to a lower-income family member, the family can shift investment income to the lower-income earner, thereby reducing the overall tax burden. This strategy is particularly beneficial in Canada, where income tax rates are progressive, meaning higher incomes are taxed at higher rates.

### Requirements for Valid Loans for Tax Purposes

For a loan to be valid for tax purposes in Canada, it must meet specific criteria set by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). These requirements include:

1. **Prescribed Interest Rate**: The loan must carry an interest rate at least equal to the CRA's prescribed rate at the time the loan is made. This rate is set quarterly and is designed to prevent tax avoidance through artificially low-interest loans.

2. **Formal Documentation**: The loan agreement should be documented in writing, outlining the terms, interest rate, and repayment schedule. This documentation is crucial for proving the loan's legitimacy to the CRA.

3. **Repayment Terms**: The loan must have a clear repayment schedule, and interest should be paid annually by January 30th of the following year. Failure to adhere to these terms can result in the loan being considered a gift, triggering attribution rules.

### Avoiding Attribution Rules with Properly Structured Loans

Attribution rules are designed to prevent income splitting by attributing income earned on transferred assets back to the original owner. However, when loans are structured correctly, these rules can be avoided. Key strategies include:

- **Charging the Prescribed Interest Rate**: By charging at least the prescribed rate, the loan is considered a legitimate financial transaction, thus avoiding attribution.

- **Timely Interest Payments**: Ensuring that interest is paid annually by the stipulated deadline prevents the CRA from attributing the income back to the lender.

### Examples of Income-Splitting Loans

Consider the following example to illustrate the benefits of income-splitting loans:

**Case Study: The Smith Family**

John Smith, a high-income earner, lends $100,000 to his daughter, Emily, who is in a lower tax bracket. The loan is documented with a 3% interest rate, which is the prescribed rate at the time. Emily invests the money and earns a 5% return annually.

- **Interest Payment**: Emily pays John $3,000 in interest each year.
- **Net Income**: Emily's net income from the investment is $2,000 ($5,000 return - $3,000 interest).
- **Tax Savings**: Since Emily is in a lower tax bracket, the tax on her $2,000 net income is significantly less than if John had earned the income himself.

This setup allows the Smith family to benefit from lower overall taxes while adhering to CRA regulations.

### Glossary

- **Prescribed Interest Rate**: The minimum interest rate set by the CRA for income-splitting loans to prevent tax avoidance.
- **Income-Splitting Loan**: A loan from a higher-income family member to a lower-income family member, used to shift investment income and reduce overall tax liability.
