## 24.18 Gifting

Gifting is a powerful financial strategy that allows individuals to transfer assets to family members or other beneficiaries without immediate tax implications. In Canada, understanding the nuances of gifting, especially when it involves appreciated securities or income-producing assets, is crucial for effective wealth management and tax planning. This section delves into the intricacies of gifting, exploring the tax consequences, attribution rules, and strategies to minimize tax liabilities while adhering to Canadian tax laws.

### Understanding Gifting as a Financial Strategy

Gifting involves the transfer of ownership of an asset from one person to another without receiving anything in return. It is often used as a means to distribute wealth among family members, reduce the size of an estate, or provide financial support to loved ones. In Canada, gifting can be a tax-efficient way to transfer assets, but it requires careful planning to avoid unintended tax consequences.

#### Key Benefits of Gifting

1. **Estate Planning**: Gifting can reduce the size of an estate, potentially lowering estate taxes upon death.
2. **Family Support**: Provides financial assistance to family members, helping with education, housing, or other needs.
3. **Tax Efficiency**: Properly structured gifts can minimize tax liabilities, especially when dealing with appreciated assets.

### Tax Consequences of Gifting Appreciated Securities

When gifting appreciated securities, such as stocks or mutual funds, Canadian tax laws consider this a "deemed disposition." This means that the transfer is treated as if the asset was sold at its fair market value, triggering potential capital gains tax.

#### Deemed Disposition and Capital Gains

- **Deemed Disposition**: This tax rule applies when there is a change in ownership of an asset. For tax purposes, the asset is considered sold at its current market value, and any increase in value since the original purchase is subject to capital gains tax.
- **Capital Gain**: The profit realized from the deemed sale of a capital asset. In Canada, 50% of the capital gain is taxable.

**Example**: Suppose you purchased shares in a company for $10,000, and they are now worth $15,000. If you gift these shares to a family member, you will have a deemed disposition, and the $5,000 increase in value is considered a capital gain. You would need to report $2,500 (50% of the gain) as taxable income.

### Attribution Rules for Gifting Income-Producing Assets

When gifting income-producing assets, such as rental properties or dividend-paying stocks, the attribution rules in Canada may apply. These rules are designed to prevent income splitting and ensure that the original owner continues to pay tax on the income generated by the gifted asset.

#### How Attribution Rules Work

- **Spousal Attribution**: If you gift an income-producing asset to your spouse, any income or capital gains generated from that asset are attributed back to you for tax purposes.
- **Minor Children Attribution**: Similar rules apply when gifting to minor children. Income from the asset is attributed back to the parent, but capital gains are not.

**Example**: If you gift shares that pay dividends to your spouse, the dividends are attributed back to you, and you must report them as income. However, if the shares are sold, any capital gains are taxed in your spouse's hands.

### Structuring Gifts to Minimize Tax Liability

To effectively minimize tax liabilities when gifting, consider the following strategies:

1. **Gift Cash Instead of Securities**: By gifting cash rather than appreciated securities, you avoid triggering a deemed disposition and capital gains tax.
2. **Utilize Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)**: Encourage family members to invest gifted cash in their TFSAs, where investment growth is tax-free.
3. **Timing of Gifts**: Consider the timing of your gifts to align with lower income years, potentially reducing the overall tax impact.

### Practical Example: Gifting Strategy for a Canadian Family

Consider a Canadian family where the parents wish to gift a portion of their investment portfolio to their adult children. The parents hold a mix of stocks and mutual funds with significant unrealized gains.

1. **Assessment**: The parents assess the potential capital gains tax from a deemed disposition.
2. **Strategy**: They decide to gift cash equivalent to the value of the securities, avoiding immediate tax implications.
3. **Implementation**: The children invest the cash in their TFSAs, maximizing tax-free growth potential.

### Glossary

- **Deemed Disposition**: A tax rule that treats a transfer or change in ownership as a sale, triggering capital gains or losses.
- **Capital Gain**: The profit realized from the sale of a capital asset exceeding its purchase price.
