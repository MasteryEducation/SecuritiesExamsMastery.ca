## 24.3 Types of Income

Understanding the different types of income is crucial for effective financial planning and compliance with Canadian tax regulations. In Canada, income is generally categorized into four main types: Employment Income, Business Income, Income from Property, and Capital Gains and Losses. Each type of income is subject to different tax rules and reporting requirements, which can significantly impact an individual's or business's financial strategy.

### 1. Employment Income

Employment income is the most common type of income for many Canadians. It includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and benefits received from an employer. This type of income is taxed on a gross receipt basis, meaning the total amount received before any deductions is subject to taxation.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Taxation:** Employment income is subject to federal and provincial income taxes. Employers are required to withhold taxes at source, which means they deduct income tax, Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums from employees' pay.
- **Deductions:** Limited deductions are available for employment income. Common deductions include union dues, professional fees, and certain employment-related expenses.
- **Reporting:** Employment income is reported on the T4 slip, which is provided by employers to employees and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

#### Example:
Consider a software engineer working at a tech company in Toronto. They earn a salary of $100,000 per year. The employer withholds taxes, CPP, and EI from each paycheck. At the end of the year, the engineer receives a T4 slip detailing their total income and deductions.

### 2. Business Income

Business income refers to income earned from self-employment or operating a business. Unlike employment income, business income is taxed on a net-income basis, allowing for the deduction of business expenses.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Taxation:** Business income is subject to both federal and provincial taxes. The net income, which is the total income minus allowable business expenses, is what gets taxed.
- **Deductions:** Business owners can deduct a wide range of expenses, including office supplies, travel expenses, and advertising costs, provided they are incurred to earn business income.
- **Reporting:** Business income is reported on the T2125 form, Statement of Business or Professional Activities, as part of the personal tax return.

#### Example:
A freelance graphic designer in Vancouver earns $80,000 in a year. They incur $20,000 in business expenses, including software subscriptions and marketing costs. Their net business income is $60,000, which is subject to taxation.

### 3. Income from Property

Income from property includes interest income, dividends, and royalties. This type of income is typically taxed in the year it is earned.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Interest Income:** Earned from savings accounts, bonds, and other interest-bearing investments. It is fully taxable at the individual's marginal tax rate.
- **Dividends:** Payments received from owning shares in a corporation. Canadian dividends benefit from a dividend tax credit, which reduces the effective tax rate.
- **Royalties:** Payments for the use of property, such as intellectual property or natural resources. Royalties are included in income and taxed accordingly.

#### Example:
An investor in Montreal holds shares in a Canadian corporation and receives $5,000 in dividends. Due to the dividend tax credit, the effective tax rate on these dividends is lower than on regular income.

### 4. Capital Gains and Losses

Capital gains and losses arise from the sale of capital property, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. Only 50% of capital gains are taxable, providing a tax advantage compared to other types of income.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Capital Gains:** The profit from selling a capital asset for more than its purchase price. Only half of the capital gain is included in taxable income.
- **Capital Losses:** Occur when a capital asset is sold for less than its purchase price. Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains, reducing taxable income.
- **Reporting:** Capital gains and losses are reported on Schedule 3 of the personal tax return.

#### Example:
A Toronto resident sells shares in a company for $20,000, which they originally purchased for $15,000. The capital gain is $5,000, but only $2,500 is taxable.

### Glossary

- **Royalties:** Payments received for the use of property, such as intellectual property or natural resources.
- **Net Income:** Income after all allowable deductions and expenses have been subtracted.
