## 16.12 Calculate the Risk-Adjusted Rate of Return

In the realm of investment, understanding how to evaluate the performance of a portfolio is crucial. One of the most widely used metrics for this purpose is the Sharpe Ratio, which provides a risk-adjusted measure of return. This section will delve into the components of the Sharpe Ratio, the steps to calculate it, and how to interpret its value in the context of portfolio management.

### Understanding the Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio, named after Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, is a measure that helps investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. It is particularly useful in comparing the performance of different portfolios or investment strategies by adjusting for the risk taken to achieve those returns.

#### Components of the Sharpe Ratio

1. **Portfolio Return (\\(R_p\\))**: This is the expected return of the portfolio over a specific period. It reflects the total gain or loss from the investment.

2. **Risk-Free Rate (\\(R_f\\))**: The risk-free rate is the return on an investment with zero risk, typically represented by the yield on government Treasury bills. In Canada, this could be the yield on Canadian Treasury bills.

3. **Standard Deviation (\\(\sigma_p\\))**: This measures the volatility or risk of the portfolio's returns. A higher standard deviation indicates a higher level of risk.

The formula for the Sharpe Ratio is:

\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
{{< /katex >}}

### Steps to Calculate the Sharpe Ratio

1. **Determine the Portfolio Return (\\(R_p\\))**: Calculate the average return of the portfolio over the period of interest.

2. **Identify the Risk-Free Rate (\\(R_f\\))**: Use the current yield on a short-term government Treasury bill as the risk-free rate.

3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation (\\(\sigma_p\\))**: Compute the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns over the same period.

4. **Apply the Sharpe Ratio Formula**: Subtract the risk-free rate from the portfolio return, then divide the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns.

### Interpretation of the Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio provides a single number that represents the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more favorable risk-adjusted return, meaning the portfolio is generating more return per unit of risk.

- **Sharpe Ratio > 1**: Generally considered good, indicating that the portfolio is providing a higher return for the risk taken.
- **Sharpe Ratio < 1**: Suggests that the portfolio's returns are not compensating adequately for the risk.
- **Sharpe Ratio = 0**: Implies that the portfolio's return is equal to the risk-free rate.

### Comparing Sharpe Ratios

When comparing different portfolios or investment strategies, the Sharpe Ratio can be a valuable tool. It allows investors to assess which portfolio offers the best return for the level of risk taken. For instance, if Portfolio A has a Sharpe Ratio of 1.5 and Portfolio B has a Sharpe Ratio of 1.2, Portfolio A is considered to have a better risk-adjusted performance.

#### Example: Comparing Portfolios

Consider two Canadian mutual funds:

- **Fund A**: 
  - Return (\\(R_p\\)): 8%
  - Risk-Free Rate (\\(R_f\\)): 2%
  - Standard Deviation (\\(\sigma_p\\)): 10%

- **Fund B**: 
  - Return (\\(R_p\\)): 10%
  - Risk-Free Rate (\\(R_f\\)): 2%
  - Standard Deviation (\\(\sigma_p\\)): 15%

Calculate the Sharpe Ratios:

- **Sharpe Ratio for Fund A**: \\((8\% - 2\%) / 10\% = 0.6\\)
- **Sharpe Ratio for Fund B**: \\((10\% - 2\%) / 15\% = 0.53\\)

Despite Fund B having a higher return, Fund A has a better risk-adjusted return due to its lower volatility.

### Practical Considerations

- **Market Conditions**: The Sharpe Ratio can vary significantly with changing market conditions. It is important to consider the economic environment when interpreting the ratio.
- **Time Horizon**: The Sharpe Ratio should be calculated over a consistent time horizon to ensure comparability.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare the Sharpe Ratio of a portfolio against a relevant benchmark to assess relative performance.

### Glossary

- **Risk-Free Rate (\\(R_f\\))**: The return on an investment with zero risk, typically represented by Treasury bills.
- **Standard Deviation (\\(\sigma\\))**: Measurement of the portfolio’s volatility and risk.

### Conclusion

The Sharpe Ratio is a powerful tool for evaluating the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio. By understanding and applying this metric, investors can make more informed decisions about their investment strategies. Remember to consider the broader market context and use the Sharpe Ratio in conjunction with other performance metrics for a comprehensive analysis.

### What is the primary purpose of the Sharpe Ratio?

- [x] To measure the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio
- [ ] To calculate the total return of a portfolio
- [ ] To determine the risk-free rate
- [ ] To assess the liquidity of a portfolio

> **Explanation:** The Sharpe Ratio is used to measure the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio, helping investors understand how much return they are getting for the level of risk taken.

### Which component of the Sharpe Ratio represents the portfolio's volatility?

- [ ] Portfolio Return (\\(R_p\\))
- [ ] Risk-Free Rate (\\(R_f\\))
- [x] Standard Deviation (\\(\sigma_p\\))
- [ ] Beta

> **Explanation:** The standard deviation (\\(\sigma_p\\)) measures the portfolio's volatility and is a key component of the Sharpe Ratio.

### How is the Sharpe Ratio calculated?

- [x] \\((R_p - R_f) / \sigma_p\\)
- [ ] \\((R_p + R_f) / \sigma_p\\)
- [ ] \\((R_p - \sigma_p) / R_f\\)
- [ ] \\((R_f - R_p) / \sigma_p\\)

> **Explanation:** The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the portfolio return and dividing by the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns.

### What does a Sharpe Ratio greater than 1 indicate?

- [x] The portfolio is providing a higher return for the risk taken
- [ ] The portfolio is underperforming
- [ ] The portfolio has no risk
- [ ] The portfolio's return equals the risk-free rate

> **Explanation:** A Sharpe Ratio greater than 1 indicates that the portfolio is providing a higher return for the risk taken, which is generally considered favorable.

### If Portfolio A has a Sharpe Ratio of 0.8 and Portfolio B has a Sharpe Ratio of 1.2, which portfolio has a better risk-adjusted performance?

- [ ] Portfolio A
- [x] Portfolio B
- [ ] Both have the same performance
- [ ] Cannot be determined

> **Explanation:** Portfolio B has a better risk-adjusted performance because it has a higher Sharpe Ratio, indicating more return per unit of risk.

### What is typically used as the risk-free rate in Canada?

- [ ] Corporate bonds
- [x] Canadian Treasury bills
- [ ] Real estate investments
- [ ] Stock market index
