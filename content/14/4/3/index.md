## 16.2 Design an Investment Policy Statement

An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is a critical document in the portfolio management process, serving as a strategic guide that outlines the investment goals and strategies of a client. It acts as a roadmap for both the client and the portfolio manager, ensuring that investment decisions align with the client's objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. In this section, we will delve into the components of an IPS, its purpose, and how it is developed, particularly within the Canadian financial context.

### Definition and Purpose of an Investment Policy Statement (IPS)

An Investment Policy Statement is a formal document that articulates the investment goals, strategies, and guidelines for managing a client's portfolio. Its primary purpose is to align the expectations of the client and the portfolio manager, providing a clear framework for decision-making and performance evaluation. The IPS serves as a reference point for both parties, helping to prevent misunderstandings and ensuring that the investment strategy remains consistent with the client's objectives over time.

### Components of an IPS

A well-crafted IPS includes several key components, each serving a specific function in guiding the portfolio management process:

#### Operating Rules and Guidelines

Operating rules and guidelines define how the portfolio will be managed and maintained. These rules establish the parameters within which investment decisions are made, including risk management strategies, liquidity requirements, and any specific mandates or restrictions imposed by the client. For example, a client may specify that their portfolio should maintain a certain level of liquidity to meet short-term cash needs.

#### Defined Asset Allocation

Asset allocation is a critical component of the IPS, detailing how the portfolio's assets will be distributed across different asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. The asset allocation strategy is designed to balance risk and return in accordance with the client's risk tolerance and investment objectives. For instance, a conservative investor might have a higher allocation to fixed income securities, while an aggressive investor might favor equities.

#### Detailed Investment Objectives and Constraints

The IPS outlines the client's investment objectives, such as capital preservation, income generation, or growth, along with any constraints that may impact the investment strategy. Constraints can include factors such as tax considerations, legal restrictions, or ethical preferences. For example, a client may wish to exclude investments in certain industries for ethical reasons.

#### Lists of Acceptable and Prohibited Investments

The IPS specifies which types of investments are acceptable and which are prohibited, based on the client's preferences and risk tolerance. This section helps to ensure that the portfolio manager selects investments that align with the client's values and objectives. For example, a client may prohibit investments in high-risk derivatives or certain foreign markets.

#### Performance Appraisal Methods

Performance appraisal methods are used to evaluate the portfolio's success in meeting its objectives. The IPS should outline the metrics and benchmarks that will be used to assess performance, such as comparing the portfolio's returns to a relevant market index. This section also defines the frequency and format of performance reports, ensuring that the client receives regular updates on their portfolio's progress.

#### Schedule for Portfolio Reviews

Regular portfolio reviews are essential for maintaining alignment with the client's objectives and adapting to changing market conditions. The IPS should specify the frequency of these reviews and the criteria that will trigger a re-evaluation of the investment strategy. For example, a portfolio might be reviewed quarterly, with additional reviews triggered by significant market events or changes in the client's financial situation.

### Importance of Formalizing the IPS

Formalizing the IPS is crucial for aligning the expectations of the client and the portfolio manager. A well-documented IPS provides a clear framework for decision-making, reducing the potential for misunderstandings and disputes. It also serves as a reference point for evaluating the portfolio's performance and making necessary adjustments over time. By formalizing the IPS, both parties can ensure that the investment strategy remains consistent with the client's goals and risk tolerance.

### Methods of Developing an IPS

Developing an IPS involves a collaborative process between the client and the portfolio manager. This process typically begins with a comprehensive assessment of the client's financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. The New Account Application Form (NAAF) is often used as a starting point for gathering this information, providing a detailed overview of the client's financial profile.

Once the client's objectives and constraints have been identified, the portfolio manager can develop a tailored investment strategy and draft the IPS. This draft is then reviewed and refined in consultation with the client, ensuring that all aspects of the investment strategy are clearly articulated and agreed upon.

### Glossary

- **Operating Rules:** Guidelines that govern how the portfolio will be managed and maintained.
- **Performance Appraisal:** The process of evaluating the portfolio’s success in meeting its objectives.
- **Rebalancing Schedule:** The frequency and conditions under which the portfolio will be reviewed and adjusted.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Fund

Consider a Canadian pension fund that aims to provide stable, long-term returns for its beneficiaries. The IPS for this fund might include a diversified asset allocation strategy, with a mix of equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. The fund's operating rules might specify a minimum liquidity requirement to ensure that it can meet its obligations to beneficiaries. Performance appraisal methods could involve comparing the fund's returns to a benchmark index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index.

### Conclusion

Designing an Investment Policy Statement is a fundamental step in the portfolio management process, providing a structured approach to achieving a client's investment goals. By clearly defining the investment strategy, objectives, and constraints, the IPS serves as a valuable tool for aligning the expectations of the client and the portfolio manager. As the financial landscape evolves, the IPS remains a dynamic document, guiding the portfolio's adaptation to changing circumstances and ensuring that it continues to meet the client's needs.
