## Glossary for Chapter 14: Company Analysis

In this chapter, we delve into the essential terms and concepts that form the backbone of company analysis, a critical component of the Canadian Securities Course (CSC®). Understanding these terms will not only aid in passing the CSC® exam but also enhance your ability to evaluate companies effectively within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Asset Coverage Ratio
The asset coverage ratio is a financial metric that measures a company's ability to cover its debt obligations with its assets. It is calculated by dividing the company's total assets, minus its current liabilities, by its total debt. This ratio is crucial for investors and creditors as it indicates the level of risk associated with the company's debt. A higher ratio suggests that the company has more than enough assets to cover its debt, reducing the risk of default.

**Example:** Consider a Canadian manufacturing company with total assets of $500 million, current liabilities of $100 million, and total debt of $200 million. The asset coverage ratio would be calculated as follows:

{{< katex >}} \text{Asset Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}}{\text{Total Debt}} = \frac{500 - 100}{200} = 2 {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company has twice the assets needed to cover its debt obligations.

### Capital Structure
Capital structure refers to the mix of a company’s long-term debt, specific short-term debt, common equity, and preferred equity. It is a critical aspect of financial strategy, as it influences the company's risk profile and cost of capital. A well-balanced capital structure can enhance a company's value by minimizing the cost of capital while maximizing returns to shareholders.

**Example:** A Canadian tech firm might have a capital structure comprising 40% debt and 60% equity. This mix reflects the company's strategy to leverage debt for growth while maintaining a strong equity base to support stability and investor confidence.

### Cash Flow
Cash flow represents the total amount of money being transferred into and out of a business. It is a vital indicator of a company's financial health, as it reflects the company's ability to generate cash to meet its obligations, invest in growth, and return value to shareholders.

**Example:** A Canadian retail chain reports operating cash flow of $50 million, indicating strong cash generation from its core operations, which can be used for expansion or debt repayment.

### Cash Flow-to-Total Debt Outstanding Ratio
This ratio measures a company's ability to repay its total debt with its operating cash flow. It is calculated by dividing operating cash flow by total debt. A higher ratio indicates a stronger ability to cover debt obligations, which is particularly important for assessing financial stability.

**Example:** If a Canadian energy company has an operating cash flow of $100 million and total debt of $250 million, the cash flow-to-total debt outstanding ratio would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{Cash Flow-to-Total Debt Ratio} = \frac{100}{250} = 0.4 {{< /katex >}}

This suggests that the company generates 40 cents in operating cash flow for every dollar of debt, highlighting the need for careful debt management.

### Current Assets
Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted to cash within one year. They include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other short-term assets. Current assets are crucial for assessing a company's liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations.

**Example:** A Canadian food distributor might have current assets of $30 million, including $5 million in cash, $10 million in accounts receivable, and $15 million in inventory.

### Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are obligations a company needs to pay within one year. They include accounts payable, short-term debt, and other short-term liabilities. Understanding current liabilities is essential for evaluating a company's short-term financial health and liquidity.

**Example:** A Canadian construction firm may have current liabilities of $20 million, comprising $8 million in accounts payable and $12 million in short-term debt.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The debt-to-equity ratio is a financial ratio indicating the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It is calculated by dividing total debt by total equity. This ratio provides insights into a company's financial leverage and risk profile.

**Example:** A Canadian telecommunications company with total debt of $300 million and total equity of $600 million would have a debt-to-equity ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{300}{600} = 0.5 {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company uses 50 cents of debt for every dollar of equity, suggesting a balanced approach to financing.

### Deferred Tax Liabilities
Deferred tax liabilities are taxes that a company has accrued but has not yet paid. They arise from timing differences between accounting and tax recognition of income and expenses. Understanding deferred tax liabilities is important for assessing a company's future tax obligations and cash flow implications.

**Example:** A Canadian mining company may report deferred tax liabilities of $15 million due to differences in depreciation methods for accounting and tax purposes.

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a valuation method that calculates the present value of a stock based on its expected future dividends. It is particularly useful for valuing companies with stable and predictable dividend payments.

**Example:** If a Canadian utility company is expected to pay a dividend of $2 per share next year, with a growth rate of 3% and a required rate of return of 8%, the DDM valuation would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{DDM} = \frac{2}{0.08 - 0.03} = \$40 {{< /katex >}}

This suggests that the stock is worth $40 per share based on its dividend prospects.

### Dividend Yield
Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock price per share. This ratio is important for income-focused investors seeking regular returns.

**Example:** A Canadian bank with an annual dividend of $3 per share and a stock price of $60 would have a dividend yield of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{3}{60} = 0.05 \text{ or } 5\% {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that investors receive a 5% return on their investment through dividends.

### Dividends
Dividends are payments made by a corporation to its shareholder members, typically in the form of cash or additional shares. They represent a portion of the company's earnings distributed to shareholders and are a key component of total shareholder return.

**Example:** A Canadian oil company might declare a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, rewarding shareholders with a portion of its profits.

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Earnings Per Share (EPS) is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It is a key indicator of a company's profitability and is used by investors to assess financial performance.

**Example:** If a Canadian technology firm reports net income of $100 million and has 50 million shares outstanding, its EPS would be:

{{< katex >}} \text{EPS} = \frac{100}{50} = \$2 {{< /katex >}}

This means each share represents $2 of the company's earnings.

### Equity Cushion
Equity cushion refers to the amount of equity backing each preferred share, providing a buffer against financial distress. It is an important measure for preferred shareholders, as it indicates the level of protection their investment has in the event of financial difficulties.

**Example:** A Canadian real estate company with substantial equity relative to its preferred shares offers a strong equity cushion, reducing the risk for preferred shareholders.

### Financial Ratios
Financial ratios are metrics that evaluate various aspects of a company's operations and financial performance. They are used by analysts and investors to assess profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency.

**Example:** Common financial ratios include the current ratio, return on equity, and gross profit margin, each providing insights into different facets of a company's financial health.

### Goodwill
Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a buyer acquires an existing business for more than the fair value of its net identifiable assets. It reflects the value of the company's brand, customer relationships, and other intangible factors.

**Example:** A Canadian retail chain acquiring a competitor for $500 million, with net identifiable assets valued at $400 million, would record $100 million in goodwill.

### Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is a company's total sales revenue minus its cost of goods sold, divided by total sales revenue, expressed as a percentage. It measures the efficiency of production and pricing strategies.

**Example:** A Canadian apparel company with sales of $200 million and a cost of goods sold of $120 million would have a gross profit margin of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{200 - 120}{200} \times 100 = 40\% {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that 40% of sales revenue remains after covering production costs.

### Interest Coverage Ratio
The interest coverage ratio is a debt and profitability ratio used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by interest expenses.

**Example:** A Canadian manufacturing firm with EBIT of $50 million and interest expenses of $10 million would have an interest coverage ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{50}{10} = 5 {{< /katex >}}

This suggests that the company can cover its interest expenses five times over, indicating strong financial health.

### Inventory Turnover Ratio
The inventory turnover ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by average inventory. This ratio is important for assessing inventory management efficiency.

**Example:** A Canadian electronics retailer with a cost of goods sold of $100 million and average inventory of $20 million would have an inventory turnover ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company sells and replaces its inventory five times a year.

### Leverage
Leverage refers to the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital to increase the potential return of an investment. It can amplify both gains and losses, making it a critical consideration in financial strategy.

**Example:** A Canadian investment firm using leverage to enhance returns on its equity portfolio must carefully manage risk to avoid significant losses.

### Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to cover its short-term obligations. Common liquidity ratios include the current ratio and quick ratio, both of which provide insights into a company's short-term financial health.

**Example:** A Canadian pharmaceutical company with current assets of $50 million and current liabilities of $25 million would have a current ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{50}{25} = 2 {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company has twice the current assets needed to cover its short-term liabilities.

### Net Profit Margin
Net profit margin is the percentage of revenue remaining after all expenses have been deducted from sales. It is a key indicator of a company's profitability and efficiency in managing costs.

**Example:** A Canadian software company with net income of $20 million and sales of $100 million would have a net profit margin of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20\% {{< /katex >}}

This suggests that the company retains 20% of its revenue as profit.

### Operating Performance Ratios
Operating performance ratios assess how effectively a company manages its operations. These ratios include metrics like return on assets and operating margin, which provide insights into operational efficiency and profitability.

**Example:** A Canadian logistics company with a high return on assets indicates efficient use of its resources to generate profits.

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings. It is widely used by investors to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

**Example:** A Canadian financial services firm with a stock price of $50 and EPS of $5 would have a P/E ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 {{< /katex >}}

This suggests that investors are willing to pay $10 for every dollar of earnings.

### Preferred Dividend Coverage Ratio
The preferred dividend coverage ratio measures a company's ability to pay dividends to preferred shareholders from its earnings. It is calculated by dividing net income by preferred dividends. A higher ratio indicates a stronger ability to meet preferred dividend obligations.

**Example:** A Canadian utility company with net income of $100 million and preferred dividends of $10 million would have a preferred dividend coverage ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Preferred Dividend Coverage Ratio} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company can cover its preferred dividends ten times over.

### Retention Ratio
The retention ratio is the proportion of net income that is retained to grow the business, rather than paid out as dividends. It is calculated by subtracting the dividend payout ratio from 1. This ratio is important for assessing a company's reinvestment strategy.

**Example:** A Canadian tech startup with a dividend payout ratio of 20% would have a retention ratio of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \text{ or } 80\% {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company retains 80% of its earnings for growth and expansion.

### Return on Common Equity
Return on common equity measures the profitability in relation to the equity held by common shareholders. It is calculated by dividing net income by common equity. This ratio provides insights into how effectively a company uses shareholder funds to generate profits.

**Example:** A Canadian bank with net income of $200 million and common equity of $1 billion would have a return on common equity of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Return on Common Equity} = \frac{200}{1000} \times 100 = 20\% {{< /katex >}}

This suggests that the bank generates a 20% return on the equity invested by common shareholders.

### Working Capital
Working capital is the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities. It is a measure of a company's short-term financial health and operational efficiency. Positive working capital indicates that a company can cover its short-term obligations, while negative working capital may signal financial distress.

**Example:** A Canadian manufacturing company with current assets of $80 million and current liabilities of $50 million would have working capital of:

{{< katex >}} \text{Working Capital} = 80 - 50 = \$30 \text{ million} {{< /katex >}}

This indicates that the company has $30 million in excess current assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
