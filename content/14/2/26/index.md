## 14.25 Review Questions

In this section, we provide a comprehensive set of review questions designed to test your understanding of company analysis concepts. These questions will help you assess your grasp of financial ratio calculations, trend analysis, and the interpretation of financial statements. By engaging with these questions, you will be encouraged to apply the concepts learned in practical scenarios, enhancing your analytical skills and preparing you for real-world financial analysis.

### Understanding Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are crucial tools in company analysis, providing insights into a company's performance, financial health, and operational efficiency. Let's explore some key ratios and their implications:

1. **Liquidity Ratios**: These ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. The current ratio and quick ratio are commonly used liquidity ratios.

2. **Profitability Ratios**: These ratios assess a company's ability to generate profit relative to its revenue, assets, or equity. Examples include the net profit margin, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE).

3. **Leverage Ratios**: These ratios evaluate the extent of a company's financial leverage and its ability to meet long-term obligations. The debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio are typical leverage ratios.

4. **Efficiency Ratios**: These ratios indicate how effectively a company utilizes its assets. The inventory turnover ratio and accounts receivable turnover ratio are examples of efficiency ratios.

5. **Market Value Ratios**: These ratios provide insights into a company's market performance. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and market-to-book ratio are commonly used market value ratios.

### Trend Analysis

Trend analysis involves examining financial statements over multiple periods to identify patterns or trends in a company's performance. This analysis helps in forecasting future performance and making informed investment decisions.

- **Horizontal Analysis**: This method compares financial data over several periods, highlighting growth patterns or declines in specific line items.

- **Vertical Analysis**: This approach involves expressing each item in a financial statement as a percentage of a base figure, such as total sales or total assets, to assess relative size and significance.

### Interpretation of Financial Statements

Interpreting financial statements involves analyzing the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement to understand a company's financial position and performance.

- **Balance Sheet Analysis**: Focuses on assessing a company's assets, liabilities, and equity to determine its financial stability and liquidity.

- **Income Statement Analysis**: Evaluates a company's revenue, expenses, and profitability over a specific period, providing insights into operational efficiency.

- **Cash Flow Statement Analysis**: Examines cash inflows and outflows to assess a company's liquidity and financial flexibility.

### Practical Application

To effectively apply these concepts, consider the following practical example:

**Case Study: Analyzing a Canadian Bank**

Let's analyze the financial statements of a major Canadian bank, such as the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). By calculating key financial ratios and conducting trend analysis, we can gain insights into RBC's financial health and performance.

1. **Calculate the Current Ratio**: Divide RBC's current assets by its current liabilities to assess its liquidity position.

2. **Analyze the Net Profit Margin**: Determine RBC's profitability by dividing net income by total revenue.

3. **Evaluate the Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Assess RBC's financial leverage by dividing total liabilities by shareholders' equity.

4. **Conduct Horizontal Analysis**: Compare RBC's revenue and net income over the past three years to identify growth trends.

5. **Perform Vertical Analysis**: Express RBC's income statement items as a percentage of total revenue to evaluate cost structure.

By applying these analytical techniques, you can develop a comprehensive understanding of RBC's financial performance and make informed investment decisions.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices**: Always use multiple ratios and analysis methods to gain a holistic view of a company's financial health. Consider industry benchmarks and economic conditions when interpreting results.

- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid relying solely on a single ratio or analysis method. Be cautious of seasonal variations and one-time events that may distort financial data.
