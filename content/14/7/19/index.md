## 19.18 Active Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a popular investment vehicle due to their flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. Within the ETF universe, actively managed ETFs offer a unique proposition by combining the benefits of traditional ETFs with active management strategies. This section delves into the nuances of actively managed ETFs, their distinct characteristics, and the challenges they face, particularly in the Canadian financial market.

### Understanding Actively Managed ETFs

An **Actively Managed ETF** is a type of ETF where portfolio managers actively make investment decisions with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index. Unlike passive ETFs, which aim to replicate the performance of a specific index, actively managed ETFs leverage the expertise of fund managers to select securities they believe will provide superior returns.

#### Key Differences Between Active and Passive ETFs

1. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Active ETFs:** Rely on the skill and judgment of portfolio managers to select investments. The goal is to outperform a benchmark index through strategic asset allocation and security selection.
   - **Passive ETFs:** Aim to mirror the performance of a specific index by holding a similar composition of securities. The focus is on minimizing tracking error and maintaining low costs.

2. **Cost Structure:**
   - **Active ETFs:** Typically have higher management fees compared to passive ETFs due to the active involvement of fund managers.
   - **Passive ETFs:** Generally have lower fees as they require less active management and trading.

3. **Performance Goals:**
   - **Active ETFs:** Seek to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark index, often taking on additional risk to do so.
   - **Passive ETFs:** Aim to match the performance of the index, focusing on consistency and predictability.

### Challenges in Managing Active ETFs

Managing an actively managed ETF presents several challenges, particularly in maintaining transparency and minimizing tracking error.

#### Tracking Error

Tracking error refers to the divergence between the performance of the ETF and its benchmark index. In actively managed ETFs, tracking error can be more pronounced due to the discretionary nature of investment decisions. Fund managers must carefully balance the pursuit of excess returns with the risk of deviating significantly from the benchmark.

#### Transparency

Transparency is a hallmark of ETFs, providing investors with insight into the fund's holdings and strategy. However, actively managed ETFs may face challenges in maintaining transparency while protecting proprietary investment strategies. This can lead to less frequent disclosure of holdings compared to passive ETFs, potentially impacting investor confidence.

### Examples of Actively Managed ETFs

In the Canadian market, several actively managed ETFs have gained prominence. One notable example is the **Horizons Active Emerging Markets Dividend ETF (HAJ)**. This ETF focuses on providing exposure to dividend-paying companies in emerging markets, leveraging active management to identify opportunities for growth and income.

### Regulatory Considerations

Actively managed ETFs in Canada are subject to regulations set forth by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and other provincial regulatory bodies. These regulations ensure that ETFs operate transparently and in the best interest of investors.

### Practical Applications and Strategies

Investors considering actively managed ETFs should evaluate their investment goals, risk tolerance, and the expertise of the fund managers. Actively managed ETFs can be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio, offering potential for enhanced returns through strategic asset allocation.

#### Case Study: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds often utilize actively managed ETFs as part of their investment strategy. By leveraging the expertise of fund managers, these funds aim to achieve superior returns while managing risk. This approach allows pension funds to meet their long-term obligations to beneficiaries.
