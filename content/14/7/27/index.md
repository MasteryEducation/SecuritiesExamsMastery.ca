## 19.26 Investment Strategies Using Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have revolutionized the investment landscape by offering a flexible, cost-effective means to access a wide range of asset classes and market segments. This section delves into various investment strategies that leverage the unique characteristics of ETFs, providing investors with tools to construct diversified and dynamic portfolios.

### Core and Satellite Strategy

The Core and Satellite strategy is a popular portfolio construction approach that combines stable, passive core holdings with smaller, more aggressive satellite investments. The core typically consists of broad-market ETFs that provide a foundation of stability and diversification. In contrast, satellite holdings are more actively managed and can include sector-specific or thematic ETFs aimed at capitalizing on market opportunities.

#### Example Execution

Consider a Canadian investor whose core portfolio comprises a broad Canadian equity ETF, such as the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF (XIU), providing exposure to the largest companies in Canada. The satellite portion might include a technology-focused ETF, like the Evolve Cyber Security Index ETF (CYBR), to capture growth in the tech sector.

### Rebalancing

Rebalancing is essential for maintaining a desired asset allocation over time. ETFs facilitate this process by allowing investors to adjust their holdings with minimal trading costs. This strategy involves periodically buying or selling ETFs to realign a portfolio with its target allocation.

#### Example Execution

Suppose an investor's target allocation is 60% equities and 40% bonds. If market movements cause the equity portion to rise to 70%, the investor can sell a portion of their equity ETFs and purchase bond ETFs, such as the BMO Aggregate Bond Index ETF (ZAG), to restore balance.

### Tactical Asset Allocation

Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) is a dynamic strategy that adjusts asset allocation based on short-term market forecasts. ETFs are ideal for TAA due to their liquidity and broad market coverage, enabling investors to swiftly respond to changing market conditions.

#### Example Execution

An investor anticipating a downturn in the energy sector might reduce their holdings in an energy ETF, like the Horizons S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF (HXE), and increase exposure to a defensive sector ETF, such as the iShares Canadian Utilities ETF (XUT).

### Cash Management

ETFs can be used for efficient cash management, serving as a temporary parking place for funds. This strategy allows investors to maintain liquidity while earning returns, often through money market or short-term bond ETFs.

#### Example Execution

A Canadian investor with excess cash might invest in the iShares Canadian Short Term Bond Index ETF (XSB) to earn interest while keeping funds readily accessible for future opportunities.

### Targeted Market Exposure

ETFs provide targeted market exposure, allowing investors to access specific sectors, industries, or themes. This strategy is particularly useful for investors seeking to capitalize on emerging trends or niche markets.

#### Example Execution

An investor interested in the renewable energy sector might invest in the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) to gain exposure to companies involved in clean energy production and technology.

### Tax Loss Harvesting

Tax loss harvesting involves selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains taxes, while maintaining market exposure. ETFs are well-suited for this strategy due to their diversity and liquidity.

#### Example Execution

If an investor holds a Canadian equity ETF that has declined in value, they might sell it to realize a loss and purchase a similar ETF, such as the Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF (VCN), to maintain exposure to the Canadian market.

### Flexibility and Diversification with ETFs

ETFs offer unparalleled flexibility in constructing diversified portfolios. Their ability to cover a wide range of asset classes, sectors, and geographies makes them an essential tool for modern investors. Whether seeking broad market exposure or targeting specific investment themes, ETFs provide the means to build a portfolio tailored to individual goals and risk tolerance.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Investors should be aware of Canadian financial regulations and resources when implementing ETF strategies. The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and provincial securities commissions provide guidelines for ETF investments. Additionally, resources like Morningstar offer valuable insights into ETF strategies.
