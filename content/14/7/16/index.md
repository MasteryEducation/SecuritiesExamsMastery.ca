## 19.15 Types of Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a cornerstone of modern investment strategies, offering a versatile and cost-effective way to gain exposure to a wide range of asset classes. In this section, we will explore the various types of ETFs available in the market, each designed to meet specific investment goals and strategies. Understanding these types is crucial for making informed investment decisions and optimizing portfolio performance.

### Standard (Index-based) ETFs

Standard ETFs, also known as index-based ETFs, are designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index in Canada. These ETFs aim to provide investors with broad market exposure at a low cost, making them an attractive option for passive investors. By holding a diversified portfolio of securities that mirror the index, these ETFs offer a straightforward way to participate in market movements.

**Example:** The iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF (XIU) is a popular choice among Canadian investors seeking exposure to the top 60 companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

### Rules-based ETFs

Rules-based ETFs, sometimes referred to as smart beta ETFs, follow a specific set of rules or criteria to select and weight securities. Unlike traditional index-based ETFs, which rely on market capitalization, rules-based ETFs may focus on factors such as value, momentum, or volatility. This approach aims to enhance returns or reduce risk compared to standard index investing.

**Example:** The BMO Low Volatility Canadian Equity ETF (ZLB) selects stocks based on their volatility characteristics, aiming to provide a smoother return profile.

### Active ETFs

Active ETFs are managed by portfolio managers who actively select securities with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index. These ETFs offer the potential for higher returns but come with higher management fees compared to passive ETFs. Active management allows for flexibility in adapting to market conditions and exploiting investment opportunities.

**Example:** The Horizons Active Canadian Dividend ETF (HAL) focuses on generating income through dividends while actively managing the portfolio to optimize returns.

### Synthetic ETFs

Synthetic ETFs use derivatives, such as swaps, to replicate the performance of an index without holding the actual underlying securities. This approach can offer cost advantages and access to markets that may be difficult to invest in directly. However, synthetic ETFs also carry counterparty risk, as they rely on the financial stability of the derivative issuer.

**Glossary:** **Synthetic ETF:** ETF constructed using derivatives like swaps to replicate index performance without holding actual underlying securities.

**Example:** A synthetic ETF might use swaps to mimic the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index without directly investing in emerging market stocks.

### Leveraged ETFs

Leveraged ETFs aim to amplify the returns of an underlying index, often by a factor of two or three. They achieve this through the use of financial derivatives and debt. While leveraged ETFs can offer significant short-term gains, they are also subject to increased volatility and risk, making them suitable primarily for experienced investors with a high-risk tolerance.

**Glossary:** **Leveraged ETF:** ETF that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index.

**Example:** The Horizons BetaPro S&P/TSX 60 Bull Plus ETF (HXU) seeks to provide twice the daily performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index.

### Inverse ETFs

Inverse ETFs are designed to deliver the opposite performance of a specific index or benchmark. They are often used by investors looking to profit from declining markets or to hedge against potential losses in their portfolios. Like leveraged ETFs, inverse ETFs are complex instruments that require careful consideration and understanding.

**Glossary:** **Inverse ETF:** ETF designed to deliver the opposite performance of a specific index or benchmark.

**Example:** The Horizons BetaPro S&P/TSX 60 Inverse ETF (HIX) aims to provide the inverse daily performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index.

### Commodity ETFs

Commodity ETFs provide exposure to physical commodities, such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. These ETFs can be structured to hold the actual commodity, futures contracts, or a combination of both. Commodity ETFs offer investors a way to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation.

**Example:** The iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold Index ETF (XGD) invests in companies primarily involved in gold mining, offering exposure to the gold sector.

### Covered Call ETFs

Covered Call ETFs employ an options strategy known as writing covered calls to generate additional income from the underlying securities. This strategy involves selling call options on securities held in the ETF, providing income through option premiums. Covered Call ETFs are popular among income-focused investors seeking to enhance yield.

**Example:** The BMO Covered Call Canadian Banks ETF (ZWB) writes call options on Canadian bank stocks to generate additional income for investors.

### Practical Applications and Considerations

When selecting ETFs for your portfolio, consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook. Each type of ETF offers unique benefits and challenges, and understanding these nuances is key to effective portfolio management. For instance, while leveraged and inverse ETFs can provide significant short-term opportunities, they may not be suitable for long-term investment due to their inherent volatility and risk.

### Canadian Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, ETFs are subject to regulations by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and must adhere to specific disclosure and operational requirements. Investors should be aware of these regulations and consider the implications for their investment strategies.
