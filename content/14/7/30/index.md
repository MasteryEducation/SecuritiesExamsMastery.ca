## Glossary for Chapter 19: Exchange-Traded Funds

In this chapter, we delve into the world of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), a pivotal component of modern investment strategies. This glossary provides a comprehensive overview of key terms and concepts essential for understanding ETFs, particularly within the Canadian financial context. Each term is explained with clarity, supported by examples and practical insights to enhance your learning experience.

### Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)
An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that is traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and typically aim to track an index. For example, the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF tracks the performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index, which includes 60 of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).

### Management Expense Ratio (MER)
The Management Expense Ratio (MER) is the annual fee charged by ETFs for management and operational costs, expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets. For instance, if an ETF has an MER of 0.5%, it means that 0.5% of the fund's assets are used to cover these expenses annually.

### In-Kind Exchange
In-Kind Exchange refers to the process where ETF units are exchanged for underlying securities without using cash. This method minimizes tracking error and tax impacts, making it a tax-efficient way to manage ETF transactions.

### Tracking Error
Tracking Error is the difference between the performance of an ETF and its benchmark index. A low tracking error indicates that the ETF closely follows its benchmark, which is desirable for index-tracking ETFs.

### Net Asset Value (NAV)
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the value per share of an ETF based on the total value of its underlying assets minus liabilities. NAV is crucial for determining the fair value of an ETF.

### Bid-Ask Spread
The Bid-Ask Spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask) for an ETF. A narrow spread indicates high liquidity, while a wide spread suggests lower liquidity.

### Leveraged ETF
A Leveraged ETF uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. For example, a 2x leveraged ETF aims to deliver twice the daily return of its benchmark index.

### Inverse ETF
An Inverse ETF is designed to deliver the opposite performance of a specific index or benchmark. These ETFs are often used by investors to hedge against market downturns.

### Synthetic ETF
A Synthetic ETF is constructed using derivatives like swaps to replicate index performance without holding actual underlying securities. This approach can reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Covered Call Strategy
A Covered Call Strategy involves holding a long position in an asset and selling call options on that same asset to generate income. This strategy is often used to enhance yield in a portfolio.

### Capital Gains Distribution
Capital Gains Distribution refers to the distribution of profits from an ETF's sale of securities to investors. These distributions are typically taxed at favorable rates in Canada.

### Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)
The Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) is the original value of an investment, adjusted for factors like additional purchases or reinvested distributions. ACB is used to calculate capital gains or losses upon sale.

### Dividend Income
Dividend Income is income received from dividends paid by the underlying securities in an ETF. In Canada, this income is treated as ordinary income for tax purposes.

### Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic Trading involves the use of computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. This method is often used to enhance trading efficiency and reduce costs.

### Roll Yield Loss
Roll Yield Loss occurs when rolling over futures contracts from a near-term to a longer-term contract in a contango market. This loss can impact the performance of commodity ETFs.

### Designated Broker
A Designated Broker is a broker that has a contract with an ETF provider to facilitate the creation and redemption process. This role is crucial for maintaining ETF liquidity and efficiency.

### Sector ETF
A Sector ETF focuses on a specific industry sector, such as technology or healthcare. These ETFs allow investors to target specific areas of the market.

### Smart Beta
Smart Beta is an investment strategy that uses alternative index construction rules to enhance returns or reduce risk. This approach often involves factors like value, momentum, or volatility.

### Asset Allocation
Asset Allocation is the process of dividing a portfolio among different asset categories to optimize risk and return. This strategy is fundamental to portfolio management.

### Tax Loss Harvesting
Tax Loss Harvesting involves selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains taxes, thereby reducing overall tax liability. This strategy is particularly relevant in taxable accounts.

### Mutual Fund of ETFs
A Mutual Fund of ETFs holds a portfolio of ETFs instead of individual securities. This structure combines the benefits of mutual funds and ETFs.

### Exchange-Traded Note (ETN)
An Exchange-Traded Note (ETN) is a debt security issued by a bank that promises to pay a return based on the performance of an index or benchmark. ETNs carry credit risk, as they are unsecured debt obligations.

### Core and Satellite Strategy
The Core and Satellite Strategy is a portfolio construction approach that combines stable core holdings with smaller, more aggressive satellite investments. This strategy aims to balance stability and growth potential.

### Tactical Asset Allocation
Tactical Asset Allocation is a dynamic strategy that adjusts asset allocation based on short-term market forecasts. This approach seeks to capitalize on market opportunities.

### Tax Efficiency
Tax Efficiency involves minimizing tax liabilities on investment returns. ETFs are often considered tax-efficient due to their structure and in-kind redemption process.

### Correlation
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two securities move in relation to each other. Understanding correlation is vital for diversification and risk management.

### Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the ability to buy or sell an asset quickly without significantly affecting its price. High liquidity is desirable for minimizing transaction costs and market impact.

### Premium
A Premium occurs when an ETF trades above its NAV. This situation can arise due to high demand or limited supply of ETF shares.

### Discount
A Discount occurs when an ETF trades below its NAV. This situation can present buying opportunities for investors.

### Path Dependency
Path Dependency is the phenomenon where the sequence of returns affects the overall return of an investment. This concept is particularly relevant for leveraged and inverse ETFs.

### Counterparty Risk
Counterparty Risk is the risk that the other party in a financial contract will default on their obligations. This risk is significant in synthetic ETFs and ETNs.

### Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Unit (NAVPU)
Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Unit (NAVPU) is the total value of the ETF's assets minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. NAVPU is a key metric for evaluating ETF performance.

### Portfolio Optimization
Portfolio Optimization is the technique of choosing the proportions of various assets to maximize return for a given level of risk. This process involves mathematical models and simulations.

### Liquidity Risk
Liquidity Risk is the risk that an investor might not be able to buy or sell investments quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss. This risk is higher in less liquid markets or securities.

### Roll Yield
Roll Yield is the yield earned from rolling over futures contracts in a commodity ETF. This yield can be positive or negative, depending on market conditions.

### Covered Call ETF
A Covered Call ETF employs a covered call options strategy to enhance yield and reduce volatility. These ETFs are popular among income-focused investors.
