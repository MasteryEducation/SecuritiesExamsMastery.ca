## 19.3 Mutual Fund Trusts and Mutual Fund Corporations

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are both popular investment vehicles that offer diversification and professional management. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct structures and regulatory frameworks. In this section, we will explore the nuances of mutual fund trusts and corporations, delve into the regulation of ETFs under National Instrument 81-102 (NI 81-102), and examine the different types of ETFs available in the Canadian market.

### Similarities Between Mutual Fund Structures and ETFs

Both mutual funds and ETFs pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities. This pooling allows investors to gain exposure to a wide range of assets without having to buy each security individually. Here are some key similarities:

1. **Diversification**: Both mutual funds and ETFs provide investors with access to a diversified portfolio, reducing the risk associated with investing in individual securities.

2. **Professional Management**: Both investment vehicles are managed by professional portfolio managers who make decisions about asset allocation and security selection.

3. **Liquidity**: Mutual funds and ETFs offer liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares relatively easily. However, ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, providing intraday liquidity, whereas mutual fund transactions are typically processed at the end of the trading day.

4. **Regulatory Oversight**: In Canada, both mutual funds and ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight to protect investors. They must adhere to specific rules and guidelines set by regulatory bodies.

### Regulation of ETFs Under NI 81-102

In Canada, ETFs are primarily regulated under National Instrument 81-102, which sets out the rules and guidelines for mutual funds and ETFs. This regulation ensures that these investment products operate in a manner that protects investors and maintains market integrity. Key aspects of NI 81-102 include:

- **Investment Restrictions**: NI 81-102 imposes restrictions on the types of investments that ETFs can hold. For example, there are limits on the use of leverage and derivatives to manage risk and prevent excessive speculation.

- **Disclosure Requirements**: ETFs must provide detailed information about their investment strategies, risks, and performance. This transparency helps investors make informed decisions.

- **Valuation and Pricing**: NI 81-102 outlines the methods for valuing the assets held by ETFs and determining their net asset value (NAV). This ensures that the pricing of ETF units is fair and accurate.

#### Limitations on Leverage and Derivatives

Under NI 81-102, ETFs face specific limitations on the use of leverage and derivatives. These limitations are designed to protect investors by reducing the risk of significant losses. Key points include:

- **Leverage**: ETFs are generally restricted from using excessive leverage. This means they cannot borrow excessively to amplify returns, which could also amplify losses.

- **Derivatives**: While ETFs can use derivatives for hedging purposes or to gain exposure to certain assets, there are strict limits on the extent to which derivatives can be used. This helps manage risk and prevent speculative trading practices.

### Types of ETFs: Index-Based and Active ETFs

ETFs can be broadly categorized into two types: index-based ETFs and active ETFs. Each type has its own investment strategy and objectives.

#### Index-Based ETFs

Index-based ETFs are designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. These ETFs aim to provide investors with returns that closely match the performance of the underlying index. Key characteristics include:

- **Passive Management**: Index ETFs are passively managed, meaning they follow a predetermined strategy to track the index. This typically results in lower management fees compared to actively managed funds.

- **Broad Market Exposure**: By tracking an index, these ETFs offer investors exposure to a broad range of securities, providing diversification across sectors and industries.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Due to their passive nature, index ETFs often have lower expense ratios, making them a cost-effective option for investors seeking market exposure.

#### Active ETFs

Active ETFs, on the other hand, are actively managed with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index. Portfolio managers make strategic decisions about asset allocation and security selection to achieve this objective. Key characteristics include:

- **Active Management**: Unlike index ETFs, active ETFs involve active decision-making by portfolio managers, who aim to capitalize on market opportunities and generate alpha.

- **Potential for Outperformance**: Active ETFs have the potential to outperform their benchmark index, but they also come with higher management fees due to the active management approach.

- **Flexibility**: Active ETFs offer flexibility in investment strategies, allowing managers to adapt to changing market conditions and pursue specific investment themes.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the concepts discussed, let's consider a few practical examples and case studies involving Canadian financial institutions and investment strategies.

#### Example 1: Index-Based ETF

The iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF (XIU) is a popular index-based ETF in Canada. It aims to replicate the performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index, which includes 60 of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange. By investing in XIU, investors gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of Canadian blue-chip stocks.

#### Example 2: Active ETF

The BMO Tactical Dividend ETF (ZDV) is an example of an active ETF. It seeks to provide investors with a high level of income by investing in dividend-paying stocks. The portfolio manager actively selects stocks based on dividend yield, growth potential, and other factors to achieve the fund's objectives.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When investing in mutual funds and ETFs, it's important to consider best practices and be aware of common pitfalls:

- **Understand the Investment Strategy**: Before investing, ensure you understand the fund's investment strategy, objectives, and risks. This will help you align your investments with your financial goals.

- **Consider Costs**: Pay attention to management fees and expense ratios, as these can impact your overall returns. Index ETFs typically have lower fees compared to active ETFs.

- **Diversification**: Use ETFs to diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce risk.

- **Stay Informed**: Keep up to date with market trends and regulatory changes that may affect your investments. This will help you make informed decisions and adjust your portfolio as needed.
