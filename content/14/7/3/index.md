## 19.2 The Regulation and Structure of Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a cornerstone of modern investment portfolios, offering a blend of mutual fund diversification and stock-like trading flexibility. In Canada, the regulation and structure of ETFs are governed by a robust framework designed to protect investors and ensure market integrity. This section delves into the regulatory requirements, structural nuances, and the roles of key regulatory bodies in the Canadian ETF landscape.

### Regulatory Requirements for ETFs

ETFs in Canada can be structured as either mutual fund trusts or mutual fund corporations. Each structure has distinct regulatory requirements and implications for investors.

#### Mutual Fund Trusts

Most Canadian ETFs are structured as mutual fund trusts. This structure allows for the flow-through of income to investors, which can be tax-efficient. The regulatory framework for mutual fund trusts is primarily governed by National Instrument 81-102 (NI 81-102), which sets out the operational rules for mutual funds, including ETFs.

#### Mutual Fund Corporations

Some ETFs may be structured as mutual fund corporations. This structure can offer tax advantages, particularly in managing capital gains distributions. However, it is less common than the trust structure. The regulatory requirements for mutual fund corporations are also outlined in NI 81-102.

### National Instruments 81-102 and 81-104

#### National Instrument 81-102 (NI 81-102)

NI 81-102 is the cornerstone regulation for mutual funds, including ETFs, in Canada. It covers a wide range of operational aspects, such as:

- **Investment Restrictions:** Limits on the types of investments that can be held within an ETF to ensure diversification and risk management.
- **Disclosure Requirements:** Mandates comprehensive disclosure to investors, including the ETF's investment objectives, strategies, risks, and performance.
- **Valuation and Pricing:** Guidelines for the fair valuation of ETF units and the calculation of net asset value (NAV).

#### National Instrument 81-104 (NI 81-104)

NI 81-104 specifically addresses ETFs that use commodities and derivatives. It provides additional regulatory oversight for these more complex investment vehicles, ensuring that they are managed prudently and transparently. Key aspects include:

- **Leverage Limits:** Restrictions on the use of leverage to mitigate risk.
- **Derivatives Disclosure:** Enhanced disclosure requirements for ETFs using derivatives to inform investors of potential risks.

### Role of Dealers and Regulatory Bodies

#### Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA)

The MFDA is the self-regulatory organization for mutual fund dealers in Canada. While it primarily oversees mutual fund sales, its regulations indirectly impact ETFs by ensuring that dealers adhere to high standards of conduct and compliance.

#### Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC)

IIROC plays a more direct role in the regulation of ETFs. It oversees investment dealers and trading activity on Canadian debt and equity markets. IIROC's responsibilities include:

- **Market Surveillance:** Monitoring trading activity to detect and prevent market manipulation and ensure fair trading practices.
- **Dealer Regulation:** Ensuring that dealers comply with rules regarding the sale and distribution of ETFs, including suitability assessments and disclosure obligations.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the regulatory framework in action, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1: Canadian Pension Fund Strategy

A Canadian pension fund might use ETFs to gain exposure to international markets while maintaining compliance with NI 81-102. By selecting ETFs that adhere to these regulations, the fund can ensure diversification and manage risk effectively.

#### Example 2: Major Canadian Bank ETF Offering

A major Canadian bank, such as RBC or TD, may offer a suite of ETFs that comply with NI 81-104 for commodities exposure. These ETFs would provide detailed disclosures about their use of derivatives, helping investors make informed decisions.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
