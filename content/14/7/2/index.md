## 19.1 Introduction to Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a cornerstone of modern investment strategies, offering a versatile and efficient way to diversify portfolios. In this section, we will delve into the fundamental aspects of ETFs, their structure, management styles, and the regulatory framework governing them in Canada.

### What are Exchange-Traded Funds?

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. They combine the features of mutual funds and individual stocks, providing investors with the diversification benefits of mutual funds and the trading flexibility of stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur.

### Structure of ETFs

ETFs are structured as open-end mutual fund trusts, which means they can issue and redeem shares at any time based on investor demand. This structure is regulated under National Instrument (NI) 81-102, which sets out the rules and standards for mutual funds in Canada. The open-end nature allows ETFs to accommodate investor inflows and outflows without significantly impacting the fund's operations or the market price of its shares.

#### Open-End Mutual Fund Trust

An open-end mutual fund trust is a type of investment fund where the number of shares can increase or decrease based on investor activity. This flexibility allows the fund to manage its portfolio efficiently and maintain liquidity for investors.

#### National Instrument 81-102 (NI 81-102)

NI 81-102 is a Canadian securities regulation that governs the operations of mutual funds, including ETFs. It ensures that these funds adhere to specific standards regarding disclosure, investment practices, and investor protection. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the integrity and transparency of the Canadian mutual fund industry.

### Passive vs. Active Management in ETFs

ETFs can be managed passively or actively, each approach offering distinct advantages and considerations for investors.

#### Passive Management

Most ETFs are passively managed, meaning they aim to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. Passive ETFs typically have lower management fees because they do not require active decision-making by fund managers. Instead, they follow a predetermined set of rules to track the index.

#### Active Management

Active ETFs, on the other hand, involve fund managers making strategic decisions to outperform a benchmark index. These ETFs may have higher management fees due to the active involvement of fund managers in selecting securities and adjusting the portfolio. Active management can potentially offer higher returns but also comes with increased risk.

### Tradability of ETFs

One of the key features of ETFs is their tradability. Unlike mutual funds, which are priced at the end of the trading day, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices. This feature allows investors to take advantage of intraday price movements and implement various trading strategies.

#### Buying on Margin and Short Selling

ETFs can be purchased on margin, allowing investors to borrow funds to buy more shares than they could with their available capital. This leverage can amplify returns but also increases risk. Additionally, ETFs can be short-sold, enabling investors to profit from declines in the ETF's price.

#### Options Trading

Many ETFs have options available, providing investors with additional strategies for hedging or speculating on price movements. Options can be used to manage risk, generate income, or gain exposure to specific market segments.
