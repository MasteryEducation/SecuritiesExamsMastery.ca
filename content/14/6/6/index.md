## 18.5 Balanced Funds

Balanced funds are a type of mutual fund that aim to provide investors with a diversified portfolio, combining both equity and fixed-income securities. These funds are designed to offer a balanced approach to investing, providing the potential for capital appreciation while also generating income. In this section, we will explore the definition, investment strategies, and various subcategories of balanced funds, with a particular focus on their application within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Definition and Investment Strategy of Balanced Funds

Balanced funds, also known as hybrid funds, are mutual funds that invest in a mix of asset classes, primarily equities (stocks) and fixed-income securities (bonds). The primary goal of balanced funds is to achieve a balance between growth and income, while also managing risk through diversification. This makes them an attractive option for investors seeking a moderate risk-return profile.

The investment strategy of balanced funds typically involves maintaining a predetermined asset allocation between equities and fixed-income securities. This allocation is designed to provide stability during market downturns while allowing for growth during market upswings. The specific allocation can vary depending on the fund's objectives and market conditions.

### Overview of Subcategories

Balanced funds can be further categorized based on their specific investment focus and asset allocation strategies. Below are some common subcategories:

#### Canadian Equity Balanced Funds

These funds primarily invest in Canadian equities, complemented by a portion of fixed-income securities. They are ideal for investors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of Canadian companies while maintaining some level of income stability.

#### Neutral Balanced Funds

Neutral balanced funds maintain a relatively equal allocation between equities and fixed-income securities. This balanced approach aims to provide a steady return with moderate risk, making them suitable for conservative investors.

#### Fixed Income Balanced Funds

These funds emphasize fixed-income securities, with a smaller allocation to equities. They are designed for investors seeking income generation with lower exposure to equity market volatility.

#### Global Equity Balanced Funds

Global equity balanced funds invest in a diversified portfolio of international equities and fixed-income securities. This global approach allows investors to benefit from opportunities in various markets while spreading risk across different economies.

#### Tactical Balanced Funds

Tactical balanced funds actively adjust their asset allocation based on market conditions. Fund managers may increase or decrease exposure to equities or fixed-income securities to capitalize on market trends, aiming to enhance returns while managing risk.

### Diversification Between Equities and Fixed-Income Securities

Diversification is a key principle in the investment strategy of balanced funds. By spreading investments across different asset classes, balanced funds aim to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. The combination of equities and fixed-income securities provides a buffer against market volatility, as these asset classes often perform differently under varying economic conditions.

For example, during periods of economic growth, equities may outperform fixed-income securities, providing capital appreciation. Conversely, during economic downturns, fixed-income securities may offer more stability and income, offsetting potential losses in equities.

### Explanation of Asset Allocation Ranges per CIFSC

The Canadian Investment Funds Standards Committee (CIFSC) provides guidelines for asset allocation ranges within balanced funds. These ranges help categorize funds based on their investment strategies and risk profiles. Below is a general overview of asset allocation ranges for balanced funds:

- **Equity Balanced Funds:** Typically, 60-70% equities and 30-40% fixed-income securities.
- **Neutral Balanced Funds:** Generally, 50% equities and 50% fixed-income securities.
- **Fixed Income Balanced Funds:** Often, 30-40% equities and 60-70% fixed-income securities.

These ranges are not fixed and can vary depending on the fund's objectives and market conditions. Fund managers may adjust allocations within these ranges to optimize returns and manage risk.
