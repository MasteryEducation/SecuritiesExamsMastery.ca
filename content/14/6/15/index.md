## 18.14 Redemption of Mutual Fund Units or Shares

Mutual funds offer investors a convenient way to participate in a diversified portfolio of assets. One of the fundamental features of mutual funds is the right of redemption, which allows investors to sell their shares back to the fund. This section will delve into the process of redeeming mutual fund units or shares, the steps involved, and the key concepts that underpin this essential feature.

### Understanding the Right of Redemption

The right of redemption is a cornerstone of mutual fund investing. It provides investors with the flexibility to liquidate their holdings and access their capital when needed. This feature distinguishes mutual funds from other investment vehicles, such as stocks, where the sale depends on market conditions and the presence of a willing buyer.

### The Redemption Process

Redeeming mutual fund units or shares involves several key steps, each crucial to ensuring a smooth transaction. Let's explore these steps in detail:

#### 1. Client Request

The redemption process begins with the investor's decision to sell their mutual fund shares. This decision can be influenced by various factors, such as changes in financial goals, market conditions, or the need for liquidity. The investor must communicate their intention to redeem shares to their financial advisor or directly to the mutual fund company.

#### 2. Trade Placement

Once the redemption request is received, the next step is trade placement. The financial advisor or mutual fund company will initiate the sale of the specified number of shares. This step involves verifying the investor's account details and ensuring that the request complies with any applicable fund policies or restrictions.

#### 3. NAVPS Calculation

The Net Asset Value Per Share (NAVPS) is a critical component in determining the redemption price. The NAVPS is calculated at the end of each trading day by dividing the total value of the fund's assets, minus liabilities, by the number of outstanding shares. The redemption price is typically the NAVPS at the close of the business day on which the redemption request is processed.

#### 4. Proceeds Transfer

After the redemption price is determined, the proceeds from the sale are transferred to the investor. This transfer can be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT) to the investor's bank account or by issuing a cheque. The time frame for receiving the proceeds can vary depending on the mutual fund company's policies and the method of transfer chosen.

### Key Concepts and Glossary

Understanding the terminology associated with mutual fund redemptions is essential for investors. Here are some key terms:

- **Redemption Price:** The price at which a mutual fund repurchases shares from an investor, typically based on the NAVPS.
- **Instantaneous Redemption:** Immediate buyback of mutual fund shares upon investor request, subject to fund policies and market conditions.

### Practical Example: Redemption in Action

Consider an investor, Jane, who holds units in a Canadian equity mutual fund managed by RBC. Jane decides to redeem her shares to finance a new home purchase. She contacts her financial advisor on a Monday morning to initiate the redemption process. The advisor places the trade, and the NAVPS is calculated at the close of business on Monday. By Wednesday, the proceeds are transferred to Jane's bank account via EFT, allowing her to proceed with her home purchase.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When redeeming mutual fund shares, investors should consider the following best practices:

- **Timing:** Be aware of the cut-off times for redemption requests to ensure the desired NAVPS is applied.
- **Tax Implications:** Understand the tax consequences of redeeming mutual fund shares, particularly in registered accounts like RRSPs and TFSAs.
- **Fund Policies:** Review the mutual fund's prospectus for any redemption fees or restrictions that may apply.

Common pitfalls include failing to account for potential market fluctuations that could affect the NAVPS and overlooking the impact of redemption on long-term investment goals.
