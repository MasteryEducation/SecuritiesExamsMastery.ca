## 18.8 Specialty Funds

Specialty funds represent a unique segment of the mutual fund market, offering investors the opportunity to focus their investments on specific industries, sectors, or strategies. These funds can provide significant growth potential but also come with their own set of risks, particularly concentration risk. In this section, we will explore the nature of specialty funds, examine various types, and discuss the implications of investing in these niche areas.

### Understanding Specialty Funds

Specialty funds are mutual funds that concentrate their investments in a particular sector or industry, such as health care, real estate, precious metals, or biotechnology. Unlike diversified funds that spread investments across various sectors to mitigate risk, specialty funds focus on a specific area, aiming to capitalize on the growth potential within that niche.

#### Key Characteristics of Specialty Funds

1. **Sector Focus:** Specialty funds invest primarily in companies within a specific industry or sector. This focus allows fund managers to leverage their expertise in that area to select investments that they believe will outperform the broader market.

2. **Higher Volatility:** Due to their concentrated nature, specialty funds can be more volatile than diversified funds. The performance of these funds is closely tied to the fortunes of the specific sector they invest in, which can lead to significant fluctuations in value.

3. **Potential for Higher Returns:** By focusing on sectors with high growth potential, specialty funds can offer the possibility of higher returns compared to more diversified investments. However, this potential comes with increased risk.

4. **Concentration Risk:** One of the primary risks associated with specialty funds is concentration risk. This risk arises when a large percentage of a portfolio's value is invested in a single asset or sector, making the portfolio more susceptible to adverse developments in that area.

### Types of Specialty Funds

Let's delve into some common types of specialty funds and their unique characteristics:

#### Health Care Funds

Health care funds invest in companies within the health care sector, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, and health care providers. This sector is often seen as defensive, as demand for health care services tends to remain stable regardless of economic conditions. However, health care funds can also be volatile due to regulatory changes and the high cost of research and development.

**Example:** A Canadian health care fund might invest in companies like Bausch Health Companies Inc. or Telus Health, focusing on innovative treatments and technologies.

#### Real Estate Funds

Real estate funds invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) or directly in real estate properties. These funds provide exposure to the real estate market, offering potential income through dividends and capital appreciation. Real estate funds can be sensitive to interest rate changes and economic cycles.

**Example:** A Canadian real estate fund may include investments in REITs like Canadian Apartment Properties REIT or RioCan REIT, which focus on residential and commercial properties.

#### Precious Metals Funds

Precious metals funds invest in companies involved in the mining and production of precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. These funds can serve as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. However, they are also subject to commodity price volatility.

**Example:** A Canadian precious metals fund might invest in companies like Barrick Gold Corporation or Agnico Eagle Mines Limited, capitalizing on the demand for gold and other metals.

#### Biotechnology Funds

Biotechnology funds focus on companies engaged in the research and development of biotech products, including pharmaceuticals, genetic engineering, and medical devices. These funds can offer substantial growth potential but are also highly speculative due to the uncertain nature of biotech research outcomes.

**Example:** A Canadian biotechnology fund could invest in firms like AbCellera Biologics Inc. or Zymeworks Inc., which are at the forefront of biotech innovation.

### Balancing Risk and Reward

Investing in specialty funds requires a careful assessment of the balance between risk and reward. While these funds can offer significant growth potential, they also come with increased volatility and concentration risk. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before allocating a portion of their portfolio to specialty funds.

#### Strategies to Mitigate Risk

1. **Diversification:** While specialty funds are inherently concentrated, investors can mitigate risk by diversifying their overall portfolio across different asset classes and sectors.

2. **Regular Monitoring:** Given the volatile nature of specialty funds, regular monitoring of the fund's performance and the underlying sector is crucial to make informed investment decisions.

3. **Long-Term Perspective:** Specialty funds may experience short-term volatility, but a long-term investment horizon can help smooth out fluctuations and capture potential growth.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds often allocate a portion of their investments to specialty funds to enhance returns. For instance, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) might invest in a health care fund to capitalize on the aging population trend, while also maintaining a diversified portfolio to manage risk.

### Conclusion

Specialty funds offer a compelling opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on specific industry trends and growth potential. However, the concentration risk and volatility associated with these funds require careful consideration and strategic planning. By understanding the unique characteristics of specialty funds and employing risk mitigation strategies, investors can effectively incorporate these funds into their portfolios.
