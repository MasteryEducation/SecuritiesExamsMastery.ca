## Glossary for Chapter 18: Mutual Funds - Types and Features

Understanding mutual funds and their various types and features is crucial for any finance professional or investor. This glossary provides comprehensive definitions and explanations of key terms related to mutual funds, helping you navigate the complexities of mutual fund investments within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)
The Adjusted Cost Base is the original value of an investment, such as mutual fund units, adjusted for stock splits, dividends reinvested, and return of capital. This metric is essential for calculating capital gains or losses when the investment is sold. For example, if you initially purchase mutual fund units for $1,000 and reinvest dividends worth $100, your ACB becomes $1,100.

### Asset Allocation Funds
Asset Allocation Funds allow investors to adjust the proportion of different asset classes in their investment portfolio. These funds are designed to provide diversification and balance risk by investing in a mix of equities, bonds, and other securities. For instance, a Canadian asset allocation fund might hold 60% equities and 40% fixed-income securities.

### Balanced Funds
Balanced Funds invest in a mix of equities and fixed-income securities to balance risk and return. They aim to provide both income and capital appreciation. A typical balanced fund might invest 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds, offering a moderate risk profile suitable for many investors.

### Beta
Beta measures a mutual fund’s volatility relative to the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1 suggests lower volatility. For example, a Canadian equity fund with a beta of 1.2 is expected to be 20% more volatile than the overall market.

### Bond Funds
Bond Funds invest primarily in fixed-income securities, such as bonds and Treasury bills. These funds aim to provide regular income and are generally considered less risky than equity funds. A Canadian bond fund might invest in government and corporate bonds to achieve its income objectives.

### Capital Gain
A Capital Gain is the profit from the sale of an asset, such as mutual fund shares, that exceeds the purchase cost. For example, if you buy mutual fund units for $1,000 and sell them for $1,200, your capital gain is $200.

### Cash Flow
Cash Flow refers to the total amount of money being transferred into and out of a business or investment. Positive cash flow indicates more money is coming in than going out, which is crucial for maintaining liquidity and funding operations.

### Commodity Funds
Commodity Funds invest in physical commodities or commodity derivatives. These funds provide exposure to raw materials like gold, oil, or agricultural products. A Canadian commodity fund might invest in energy commodities, reflecting the country's resource-rich economy.

### Dividend
A Dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders. Mutual funds that invest in dividend-paying stocks can provide investors with regular income. For example, a Canadian equity fund might distribute dividends quarterly to its unitholders.

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
The Dividend Discount Model is a valuation method that determines the price of a stock based on the present value of its expected future dividends. This model is particularly useful for valuing companies with stable dividend payouts.

### Dividend Yield
Dividend Yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. For instance, if a stock pays annual dividends of $2 and is priced at $40, its dividend yield is 5%.

### Equity Funds
Equity Funds invest primarily in stocks to achieve long-term capital growth. These funds are suitable for investors with a higher risk tolerance seeking capital appreciation. A Canadian equity fund might focus on large-cap stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

### Equity Cushion
Equity Cushion refers to the amount of equity backing a preferred share, providing financial protection. It represents the buffer available to absorb losses before affecting preferred shareholders.

### Fixed-Dollar Withdrawal Plan
A Fixed-Dollar Withdrawal Plan is a systematic withdrawal method where a fixed amount is withdrawn periodically from an investment fund. This approach provides predictable income, making it popular among retirees.

### Fixed-Income Funds
Fixed-Income Funds focus on investments that provide regular income, such as bonds. These funds are ideal for conservative investors seeking steady income with lower risk compared to equity funds.

### Glide Path
Glide Path is the strategy of shifting asset allocation in a target-date fund as the target date approaches. This approach gradually reduces risk by increasing the allocation to fixed-income securities as the investor nears retirement.

### Index Fund
An Index Fund is designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. These funds offer broad market exposure with low management fees, making them attractive to cost-conscious investors.

### Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic Value is the actual or perceived value of a company or asset, based on fundamental analysis. It helps investors determine whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued compared to its market price.

### Life Expectancy-Adjusted Withdrawal Plan
A Life Expectancy-Adjusted Withdrawal Plan adjusts the amount withdrawn based on changes in life expectancy. This approach helps ensure that retirement savings last throughout the investor's lifetime.

### Margin of Safety
Margin of Safety is the difference between the intrinsic value and the market price, providing a buffer against errors in valuation. A larger margin of safety reduces the risk of investment losses.

### Modified Dietz Method
The Modified Dietz Method is a performance calculation method that accounts for cash flows without daily valuation. It provides a time-weighted rate of return, useful for evaluating investment performance over time.

### NAVPS (Net Asset Value per Share)
NAVPS is a mutual fund’s total net assets divided by the number of outstanding shares. It represents the per-share value of the fund and is used to determine the price at which investors can buy or sell fund shares.

### Peer Group
A Peer Group is a set of mutual funds with similar investment objectives and strategies used for performance comparisons. Analyzing a fund's performance relative to its peers helps investors assess its competitiveness.

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio is a valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings. It helps investors assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings.

### Ratio Withdrawal Plan
A Ratio Withdrawal Plan is a systematic withdrawal method based on a percentage of the investment's value. This approach adjusts withdrawals according to the investment's performance, providing flexibility in income.

### Redemption
Redemption is the act of selling mutual fund shares back to the fund. Investors can redeem their shares at the current NAVPS, subject to any applicable fees or charges.

### Retirement Savings
Retirement Savings are investments made to provide income during retirement, often held in registered accounts like RRSPs or TFSAs. These savings are crucial for ensuring financial security in retirement.

### Risk Tolerance
Risk Tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand. Understanding your risk tolerance is essential for selecting appropriate mutual funds and investment strategies.

### Systematic Withdrawal Plan
A Systematic Withdrawal Plan is a method of withdrawing a specified amount from an investment fund at regular intervals. This plan provides a steady income stream, making it popular among retirees.

### Target-Date Funds
Target-Date Funds adjust asset allocation based on the investor's target retirement date. These funds automatically shift from growth-oriented investments to more conservative ones as the target date approaches.

### T3 Form
A T3 Form is a tax slip for mutual fund distributions received by unitholders. It reports income from trusts, including mutual funds, for tax purposes in Canada.

### T5 Form
A T5 Form is a tax slip for mutual fund distributions received by shareholders. It reports investment income, such as dividends and interest, for tax purposes in Canada.

### Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)
The Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR) measures the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. It eliminates the effects of cash flows, providing an accurate measure of investment performance.

### Total Return
Total Return is the actual rate of return of an investment, including interest, capital gains, dividends, and distributions. It provides a comprehensive view of an investment's performance over time.

### Volatility
Volatility is the degree of variation of an investment's price over time. Higher volatility indicates greater price fluctuations, which can impact investment risk and return.
