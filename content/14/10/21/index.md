## 22.20 Comparison of Managed Products

In the diverse landscape of investment products, understanding the nuances of different managed products is crucial for making informed decisions. This section provides a comparative analysis of segregated funds, Labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCCs), closed-end funds, income trusts, and private equity. We will explore their structures, regulatory environments, tax implications, and risk profiles, offering a comprehensive view to aid in your investment strategy.

### Comparative Analysis of Managed Products

Managed products are investment vehicles that pool together funds from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. Each type of managed product has unique characteristics that cater to different investor needs and objectives. Let's delve into each product type and highlight their key differentiators.

#### Segregated Funds

**Structure:** Segregated funds are insurance products that combine investment and insurance benefits. They are similar to mutual funds but are offered by insurance companies.

**Regulation:** Governed by insurance regulations, segregated funds provide a degree of protection against market downturns through maturity and death benefit guarantees.

**Tax Implications:** Segregated funds offer potential tax advantages, such as the ability to bypass probate fees upon the policyholder's death.

**Risk Profile:** Generally lower risk due to the guarantees provided, but these guarantees come at a cost, often reflected in higher management fees.

#### Labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCCs)

**Structure:** LSVCCs are investment funds that provide venture capital to small and medium-sized businesses, often with a focus on local economic development.

**Regulation:** These funds are heavily regulated by both federal and provincial governments, with specific mandates to invest in certain types of businesses.

**Tax Implications:** Investors in LSVCCs can benefit from tax credits, making them attractive for those seeking tax-efficient investment options.

**Risk Profile:** Higher risk due to the nature of venture capital investments, which involve early-stage companies with uncertain futures.

#### Closed-End Funds

**Structure:** Closed-end funds raise a fixed amount of capital through an initial public offering (IPO) and then trade on stock exchanges like a stock.

**Regulation:** Subject to securities regulations, these funds have a fixed number of shares and do not issue new shares or redeem existing ones.

**Tax Implications:** Investors may face capital gains taxes when selling shares, but the fund itself does not have to distribute capital gains annually.

**Risk Profile:** The risk varies depending on the underlying assets, but closed-end funds can trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value (NAV), adding an additional layer of market risk.

#### Income Trusts

**Structure:** Income trusts are investment vehicles that hold income-generating assets, such as real estate or natural resources, and distribute the income to unit holders.

**Regulation:** They are structured to pass income directly to investors, avoiding corporate income tax at the trust level.

**Tax Implications:** Investors receive distributions that may be taxed as income, dividends, or capital gains, depending on the trust's structure.

**Risk Profile:** Income trusts can offer high yields but are sensitive to interest rate changes and economic conditions affecting the underlying assets.

#### Private Equity

**Structure:** Private equity involves investing in private companies or buying out public companies to restructure them and eventually sell at a profit.

**Regulation:** Less regulated than public markets, private equity investments are typically accessible only to accredited investors due to their complexity and risk.

**Tax Implications:** Returns are often realized as capital gains, which can be tax-efficient, but the illiquid nature of these investments requires a long-term commitment.

**Risk Profile:** High risk with the potential for high returns, private equity investments are subject to business, financial, and market risks.
