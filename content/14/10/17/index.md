## 22.16 Types of Private Equity

Private equity (PE) represents a significant segment of the investment landscape, offering opportunities for substantial returns through various strategies. In this section, we will delve into the different types of private equity investments, including Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs), growth capital, turnaround investments, early-stage and late-stage venture capital, distressed debt, and mezzanine financing. Each type has unique characteristics, advantages, and challenges, which we will explore in detail.

### Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)

Leveraged Buyouts are a common form of private equity investment where a company is acquired using a significant amount of borrowed money. The assets of the company being acquired often serve as collateral for the loans. The goal is to improve the company's financial performance and eventually sell it at a profit.

#### Pros:
- **Potential for High Returns:** LBOs can generate substantial returns if the acquired company is successfully turned around.
- **Control:** Investors gain control over the company, allowing them to implement strategic changes.

#### Cons:
- **High Risk:** The use of leverage increases financial risk, particularly if the company's cash flows are insufficient to cover debt payments.
- **Complexity:** LBOs involve complex financial structuring and require significant expertise.

#### Example:
A notable example of an LBO is the acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King in 2014, which was financed through a combination of debt and equity.

### Growth Capital

Growth capital involves investing in established companies that require capital to expand or restructure operations, enter new markets, or finance significant acquisitions.

#### Pros:
- **Less Risky:** Compared to LBOs, growth capital investments are typically less risky as they involve established companies.
- **Support for Expansion:** Provides the necessary funds for companies to grow and increase their market share.

#### Cons:
- **Moderate Returns:** Returns may be lower compared to other PE types due to the lower risk.
- **Limited Control:** Investors may have less control over the company's operations compared to LBOs.

#### Example:
A Canadian example is the investment by OMERS Private Equity in Caliber Collision, supporting its expansion across North America.

### Turnaround Investments

Turnaround investments focus on companies experiencing operational or financial difficulties. The objective is to improve the company's profitability and financial health.

#### Pros:
- **High Return Potential:** Successful turnarounds can lead to significant returns.
- **Value Creation:** Investors can create value by improving operational efficiencies and financial management.

#### Cons:
- **High Risk:** Turnaround investments carry high risk due to the distressed nature of the companies.
- **Time-Intensive:** These investments often require significant time and resources to achieve a successful turnaround.

#### Example:
Fairfax Financial's investment in BlackBerry is an example of a turnaround strategy aimed at revitalizing the company's fortunes.

### Early-Stage Venture Capital

Early-stage venture capital involves investing in startups and young companies with high growth potential. These investments are typically made in exchange for equity.

#### Pros:
- **High Growth Potential:** Startups can offer exponential growth opportunities.
- **Innovation:** Investors can support innovative ideas and technologies.

#### Cons:
- **High Risk:** Startups have a high failure rate, making these investments risky.
- **Illiquidity:** Investments are often illiquid, with long holding periods before potential exits.

#### Example:
The investment by Real Ventures in Montreal-based startup Element AI highlights early-stage venture capital in the Canadian tech sector.

### Late-Stage Venture Capital

Late-stage venture capital focuses on more mature startups that have demonstrated a viable business model and are seeking additional capital to scale operations.

#### Pros:
- **Reduced Risk:** Compared to early-stage investments, late-stage ventures have a proven track record, reducing risk.
- **Potential for High Returns:** Successful scaling can lead to substantial returns.

#### Cons:
- **Higher Valuations:** Late-stage companies often have higher valuations, which can limit upside potential.
- **Competitive Market:** There is often more competition for late-stage investments.

#### Example:
The investment by BDC Capital in Shopify during its growth phase is an example of late-stage venture capital.

### Distressed Debt

Distressed debt investing involves purchasing the debt of companies in financial distress, often at a significant discount. The goal is to profit from the company's recovery or restructuring.

#### Pros:
- **High Return Potential:** Distressed debt can offer high returns if the company successfully restructures.
- **Strategic Influence:** Investors can influence the restructuring process.

#### Cons:
- **High Risk:** These investments are risky due to the financial instability of the companies.
- **Complexity:** Requires expertise in bankruptcy and restructuring processes.

#### Example:
Brookfield Asset Management's investment in distressed real estate assets during economic downturns illustrates this strategy.

### Mezzanine Financing

Mezzanine financing is a hybrid of debt and equity financing, often used to fund the expansion of existing companies. It is subordinate to senior debt but senior to equity.

#### Pros:
- **Flexible Financing:** Offers flexible financing solutions with potential equity upside.
- **Less Dilution:** Companies can raise capital without significant equity dilution.

#### Cons:
- **Higher Cost:** Mezzanine financing is more expensive than traditional debt due to its subordinate position.
- **Complexity:** Structuring mezzanine deals can be complex.

#### Example:
The use of mezzanine financing by Canadian pension funds to support infrastructure projects is a common practice.
