## 22.19 Disadvantages of Listed Private Equity

Listed private equity (LPE) offers investors an opportunity to gain exposure to private equity investments through publicly traded vehicles. While this can provide access to a traditionally illiquid asset class, it also comes with its own set of disadvantages. Understanding these drawbacks is crucial for investors, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape, where market dynamics and regulatory frameworks can influence investment outcomes.

### Illiquidity and Long Holding Periods

Despite being publicly traded, listed private equity can still suffer from illiquidity. Illiquidity refers to the difficulty in selling an investment quickly without affecting its price. In the context of LPE, this can manifest in several ways:

- **Limited Trading Volume:** LPE shares may not trade as frequently as other public equities, leading to wider bid-ask spreads and potential challenges in executing large transactions without impacting the market price.
  
- **Long Investment Horizons:** Private equity investments typically require long holding periods to realize value, as they involve restructuring or growing businesses over time. This characteristic is inherited by LPEs, meaning investors may need to commit to holding their shares for extended periods to achieve desired returns.

#### Practical Example

Consider a Canadian pension fund investing in a listed private equity firm that focuses on technology startups. While the fund can buy and sell shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the underlying investments in startups may take years to mature, limiting liquidity and requiring patience from investors.

### Dependence on Managerial Expertise and Key Personnel

The success of listed private equity investments heavily relies on the expertise and decision-making abilities of the management team. This dependence introduces several risks:

- **Key Person Risk:** The departure of key personnel can significantly impact the performance of the investment. Skilled managers are crucial for identifying opportunities, executing strategies, and navigating complex market environments.

- **Managerial Performance:** The effectiveness of the management team in executing the private equity strategy directly affects returns. Poor decisions or mismanagement can lead to suboptimal outcomes.

#### Case Study: Canadian Bank Involvement

A major Canadian bank, such as RBC, may invest in a listed private equity firm with a strong management team known for its expertise in the energy sector. If key team members leave, the bank's investment could suffer due to a loss of strategic direction and industry knowledge.

### Volatility and Market Risk

Listed private equity shares are subject to the same market risks and volatility as other publicly traded securities. This can lead to fluctuations in share prices that may not reflect the underlying value of the private equity investments:

- **Market Sentiment:** Share prices can be influenced by broader market trends and investor sentiment, leading to volatility unrelated to the performance of the underlying assets.

- **Economic Conditions:** Changes in economic conditions, such as interest rates or geopolitical events, can impact the valuation of listed private equity shares.

### Potential for Concentration Risk

Listed private equity investments may be concentrated in specific sectors or types of investments, leading to concentration risk. This risk arises when a portfolio lacks diversification, making it vulnerable to adverse developments in a particular area:

- **Sector Focus:** LPE firms often specialize in certain industries, such as technology or healthcare. A downturn in these sectors can disproportionately affect the investment's performance.

- **Geographic Concentration:** Investments may also be concentrated in specific regions, exposing them to localized economic or political risks.

#### Example: Sector Concentration

A listed private equity firm with a focus on Canadian natural resources may face significant risks if commodity prices decline, impacting the firm's overall performance and share price.

Understanding the disadvantages, such as illiquidity, dependence on managerial expertise, volatility, and concentration risk, is essential for making informed investment decisions. By considering these factors and leveraging resources for further exploration, investors can better navigate the complexities of listed private equity within the Canadian financial landscape.
