## 22.4 Features of Segregated Funds

Segregated funds are a unique investment vehicle available in Canada, combining elements of insurance and mutual funds. They offer distinct features such as maturity guarantees, death benefits, and creditor protection, making them an attractive option for certain investors. This section delves into these features, providing a comprehensive understanding of how they operate and their implications for investors.

### Maturity Guarantees

One of the hallmark features of segregated funds is the maturity guarantee. This guarantee ensures that the investor will receive at least a minimum percentage of their original investment back at the end of a specified term, typically 10 years. The standard maturity guarantee is often set at 75% to 100% of the initial investment, depending on the specific fund and the terms set by the insurance company.

#### Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements for maturity guarantees are regulated to ensure investor protection. In Canada, these guarantees are typically backed by the insurance company offering the segregated fund, providing a layer of security not found in traditional mutual funds. This feature is particularly appealing during volatile market conditions, as it offers a safety net against market downturns.

#### Practical Example

Consider an investor who places $100,000 into a segregated fund with a 10-year maturity guarantee of 75%. Regardless of market performance, the investor is assured of receiving at least $75,000 at the end of the term. This guarantee provides peace of mind, particularly for risk-averse investors or those nearing retirement.

### Death Benefits

Segregated funds also offer death benefits, which ensure that beneficiaries receive a guaranteed amount upon the investor's death. This feature is similar to life insurance and can be a crucial component of estate planning.

#### How Death Benefits Operate

The death benefit typically guarantees that the beneficiaries will receive the greater of the market value of the fund or a pre-determined percentage of the original investment, often 75% to 100%. This ensures that the investor's heirs are protected from market volatility, preserving the intended legacy.

#### Case Study: Canadian Pension Fund

A Canadian pension fund might use segregated funds as part of its strategy to ensure that beneficiaries receive a stable payout, regardless of market conditions. By incorporating segregated funds with robust death benefits, the fund can provide a reliable income stream to retirees and their families.

### Creditor Protection

One of the most compelling features of segregated funds is creditor protection. This protection shields the investor's assets from being claimed by creditors in the event of bankruptcy, provided certain conditions are met.

#### Mechanisms of Creditor Protection

Creditor protection is afforded because segregated funds are considered insurance products. As such, they are governed by insurance legislation, which offers protection not available to traditional investment products. To qualify for creditor protection, the beneficiary designation must be irrevocable or fall under a specific class, such as a spouse, child, grandchild, or parent.

#### Real-World Application

For business owners or professionals at risk of litigation, segregated funds offer a strategic way to safeguard personal assets. By investing in segregated funds, these individuals can protect their wealth from potential creditors, ensuring financial stability even in adverse circumstances.

### Age Restrictions and Reset Dates

Segregated funds often come with age restrictions and reset dates, which can impact the guarantees offered.

#### Age Restrictions

Age restrictions may apply to certain features of segregated funds, such as the availability of maturity guarantees or death benefits. These restrictions are typically set by the insurance company and can vary between products.

#### Reset Dates

Reset dates allow investors to lock in gains by resetting the maturity guarantee to a higher value. This feature can be particularly beneficial in rising markets, as it enables investors to secure a higher guaranteed amount for the future.
