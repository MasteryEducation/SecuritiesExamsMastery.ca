## 22.18 Advantages of Listed Private Equity

Listed private equity (LPE) offers a unique investment opportunity that combines the benefits of private equity with the liquidity and transparency of publicly traded securities. This section explores the advantages of listed private equity, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape, and provides insights into how investors can leverage these benefits to enhance their portfolios.

### Access to Detailed Investment Information and Transparency

One of the primary advantages of listed private equity is the level of transparency it offers. Unlike traditional private equity investments, which often lack detailed public information, listed private equity provides investors with access to comprehensive financial reports, performance metrics, and strategic updates. This transparency is crucial for informed decision-making and risk assessment.

#### Understanding Transparency

**Transparency** in the context of listed private equity refers to the availability of clear, accurate, and timely information about the investment. This includes financial statements, management discussions, and market analyses that are regularly disclosed to the public. In Canada, regulatory bodies such as the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) ensure that listed entities adhere to stringent reporting standards, providing investors with reliable data to evaluate their investments.

#### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), often invest in listed private equity to benefit from transparency. By accessing detailed reports and analyses, these funds can make strategic decisions that align with their long-term investment goals while managing risks effectively.

### Ability to Influence Management Decisions Through Share Ownership

Investing in listed private equity also provides shareholders with the opportunity to influence management decisions. As part-owners of the company, shareholders can vote on key issues, such as board appointments and strategic initiatives, thereby playing an active role in shaping the company's future.

#### Shareholder Influence in Action

For instance, shareholders of a listed private equity firm like Onex Corporation, a major Canadian investment firm, can participate in annual general meetings and vote on significant corporate matters. This level of involvement allows investors to align the company's strategies with their own investment objectives and ethical considerations.

### Professional Management and Diversified Portfolio

Listed private equity firms are typically managed by experienced professionals who specialize in identifying and capitalizing on investment opportunities. These firms often maintain diversified portfolios, spreading risk across various sectors and geographies.

#### Benefits of Professional Management

Professional management teams bring expertise in due diligence, market analysis, and strategic planning, which can enhance the performance of the investment portfolio. For example, Brookfield Asset Management, a leading Canadian alternative asset manager, employs a team of experts to manage its diverse portfolio, which includes real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy assets.

### Potential for Higher Returns Through Active Management and Strategic Investments

Listed private equity offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional public equity investments. This potential is driven by active management strategies and the ability to invest in high-growth private companies before they go public.

#### Case Study: Strategic Investments by Canadian Banks

Major Canadian banks, such as RBC and TD, have leveraged listed private equity to achieve higher returns. By investing in private companies with strong growth prospects, these banks have been able to enhance their portfolios and deliver superior returns to their shareholders.

### Conclusion

Listed private equity presents a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking transparency, influence, professional management, and the potential for higher returns. By understanding the advantages of listed private equity and leveraging these benefits, investors can enhance their portfolios and achieve their financial goals within the Canadian market.
