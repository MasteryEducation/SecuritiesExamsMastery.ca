## Glossary for Chapter 22: Other Managed Products

In this chapter, we delve into the world of other managed products, a crucial component of the Canadian financial landscape. Understanding these terms is essential for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of investment strategies, regulatory frameworks, and financial planning in Canada. This glossary provides clear definitions and practical examples to enhance your comprehension and application of these concepts.

### Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)
The Adjusted Cost Base is the original value of an investment, such as mutual fund units, adjusted for stock splits, dividends reinvested, and return of capital. This calculation is crucial for determining capital gains or losses when the investment is sold. For example, if you purchase mutual fund units for $10,000 and reinvest dividends worth $500, your ACB becomes $10,500. Understanding ACB helps in accurate tax reporting and investment analysis.

### Annuitant
An annuitant is the person whose life is insured under a segregated fund contract. In the context of segregated funds, the annuitant's age and life expectancy can influence the terms and benefits of the contract, such as maturity guarantees and death benefits. For instance, a younger annuitant might have a longer investment horizon, affecting the fund's asset allocation strategy.

### Asset Allocation
Asset allocation is the process of distributing investment funds among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. This strategy aims to balance risk and reward according to an investor's goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. A typical asset allocation for a moderate-risk investor might include 60% equities, 30% fixed income, and 10% cash. Effective asset allocation can enhance portfolio performance and mitigate risks.

### Assuris
Assuris is a not-for-profit organization that provides protection against the insolvency of member insurance companies in Canada. If a member company fails, Assuris ensures that policyholders retain a portion of their benefits, such as death benefits or maturity guarantees from segregated funds. This protection fosters confidence in the insurance industry and safeguards investors' interests.

### Beta
Beta is a measure of a security's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1 suggests lower volatility. For example, a stock with a beta of 1.2 is expected to be 20% more volatile than the market. Understanding beta helps investors assess the risk associated with individual securities and construct diversified portfolios.

### Business Trust
A business trust holds income-generating businesses and distributes income to unitholders. These trusts are often used to invest in sectors like real estate, energy, or infrastructure. For example, a real estate investment trust (REIT) might own and manage a portfolio of commercial properties, distributing rental income to its investors. Business trusts offer a way to invest in income-producing assets with potential tax advantages.

### Closed-End Discretionary Funds
Closed-end discretionary funds are closed-end funds that have the flexibility to buy back shares periodically at the manager’s discretion. Unlike open-end funds, which issue and redeem shares on demand, closed-end funds trade on stock exchanges and have a fixed number of shares. This structure allows managers to pursue long-term investment strategies without the pressure of daily redemptions.

### Capital Gain
A capital gain is a profit from the sale of an asset above its purchase price. For example, if you buy shares for $5,000 and sell them for $7,000, you realize a capital gain of $2,000. In Canada, 50% of capital gains are taxable, making it essential to track and report these gains accurately for tax purposes.

### Creditor Protection
Creditor protection refers to the legal protection of segregated fund assets from being claimed by creditors in bankruptcy. This feature makes segregated funds an attractive option for investors seeking to safeguard their assets from potential financial liabilities. For instance, business owners might use segregated funds to protect personal assets from business-related debts.

### Dividend
A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders. Dividends can be paid in cash or additional shares and are typically issued by established companies with stable earnings. For example, a company might declare a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, providing shareholders with a regular income stream.

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
The Dividend Discount Model is a valuation method that determines the price of a stock based on the present value of its expected future dividends. This model is particularly useful for valuing dividend-paying stocks. For instance, if a stock is expected to pay a dividend of $2 per year and the required rate of return is 10%, the DDM would value the stock at $20.

### Dividend Yield
Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock's current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $1 and is priced at $20, its dividend yield is 5%. This metric helps investors assess the income-generating potential of a stock.

### Equity Funds
Equity funds are mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks to achieve long-term capital growth. These funds can focus on specific sectors, regions, or investment styles, such as growth or value investing. For example, a Canadian equity fund might invest in a diversified portfolio of Canadian companies, aiming to capitalize on the country's economic growth.

### Equity Cushion
The equity cushion is the amount of equity backing a preferred share, providing financial protection. It represents the buffer between the value of the company's assets and its liabilities, ensuring that preferred shareholders have a claim on the company's assets before common shareholders in the event of liquidation.

### Fixed-Income Funds
Fixed-income funds invest primarily in bonds and other fixed-income securities, providing regular income to investors. These funds are suitable for conservative investors seeking stable returns and lower risk. For example, a Canadian bond fund might invest in government and corporate bonds, offering a predictable income stream.

### Glide Path
A glide path is an investment strategy for target-date funds that gradually reduces exposure to riskier assets as the target date approaches. This approach aims to protect investors' capital as they near retirement or other financial goals. For instance, a target-date fund might start with a high allocation to equities and gradually shift to bonds and cash as the target date nears.

### Income Trust
An income trust is an investment vehicle that holds income-generating assets like REITs and business trusts, distributing income to unitholders. These trusts are popular in Canada for their tax-efficient structure and ability to provide steady income streams. For example, an energy trust might own and operate oil and gas assets, distributing profits to investors.

### Labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporation (LSVCC)
LSVCCs are funds sponsored by labour organizations to invest in small and emerging businesses, offering tax credits to investors. These funds support economic development and job creation while providing investors with potential tax benefits. For example, an LSVCC might invest in a startup technology company, helping it grow and succeed.

### Life Expectancy-Adjusted Withdrawal Plan
A life expectancy-adjusted withdrawal plan adjusts the withdrawal amount based on the investor's life expectancy. This approach helps ensure that retirees do not outlive their savings, providing a sustainable income stream throughout retirement. For example, a retiree might start with a higher withdrawal rate and gradually reduce it as they age.

### Leveraged Buyout (LBO)
A leveraged buyout is the acquisition of a company using a significant amount of borrowed money. This strategy allows investors to control a company with a relatively small equity investment, using the company's assets as collateral for the debt. LBOs are common in private equity and can lead to significant returns if the acquired company performs well.

### Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its price. Highly liquid assets, like stocks and bonds, can be quickly sold in the market, while illiquid assets, like real estate, may take longer to sell. Liquidity is an important consideration for investors, as it affects their ability to access funds when needed.

### Management Expense Ratio (MER)
The Management Expense Ratio is the total annual fund operating expenses as a percentage of the fund's average assets under management. This ratio includes management fees, administrative costs, and other expenses. A lower MER indicates a more cost-effective fund, which can enhance investors' net returns over time.

### Maturity Guarantee
A maturity guarantee is a feature of segregated funds that guarantees a return at the end of a specified period, regardless of market performance. This guarantee provides investors with peace of mind, knowing that they will receive at least a minimum return on their investment. For example, a segregated fund might offer a 75% maturity guarantee over a 10-year period.

### Net Asset Value (NAV)
Net Asset Value is the value per share of a mutual fund or closed-end fund. It is calculated by dividing the total value of the fund's assets by the number of shares outstanding. NAV is a key metric for investors, as it reflects the fund's performance and helps determine the price at which shares can be bought or sold.

### Private Equity
Private equity involves investments in private companies or buyouts of public companies, often involving active management to improve profitability and growth. Private equity firms typically invest in companies with the potential for significant value creation, using strategies like operational improvements or strategic acquisitions.

### Probate Bypass
Probate bypass is a structure that allows the transfer of assets directly to beneficiaries without going through probate. This approach can save time and reduce costs associated with the probate process, ensuring that beneficiaries receive their inheritance more quickly. Segregated funds and certain types of trusts can facilitate probate bypass.

### Redemption
Redemption is the process of selling back mutual fund shares to the fund. Investors can redeem their shares at the fund's current NAV, receiving cash in return. Redemption provides liquidity to investors, allowing them to access their funds when needed.

### Ratio Withdrawal Plan
A ratio withdrawal plan is a systematic withdrawal plan where a fixed percentage of the investment is withdrawn each year. This approach provides a predictable income stream while allowing the remaining investment to continue growing. For example, an investor might withdraw 4% of their portfolio each year, adjusting the amount based on the portfolio's value.

### REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)
A Real Estate Investment Trust is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. REITs offer investors exposure to real estate markets without the need to directly own property. For example, a Canadian REIT might own a portfolio of office buildings, collecting rental income and distributing it to shareholders.

### Risk-Return Trade-off
The risk-return trade-off is the balance between the desire for the lowest possible risk and the highest possible return. Investors must assess their risk tolerance and investment goals to determine the appropriate level of risk for their portfolio. For example, a conservative investor might prioritize capital preservation, while an aggressive investor might seek higher returns through riskier investments.

### Segregated Fund
A segregated fund is an insurance-based investment product with features like death benefits and maturity guarantees. These funds combine elements of mutual funds and insurance, offering potential growth with added protection. For example, a segregated fund might invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, providing investors with both growth potential and security.

### Tax Credit
A tax credit is a deduction from taxes owed, offered to investors in LSVCCs. These credits incentivize investment in small and emerging businesses, supporting economic development and innovation. For example, an investor might receive a 15% tax credit for investing in an LSVCC, reducing their overall tax liability.

### Turnaround Investment
A turnaround investment involves investing in underperforming or distressed companies with the aim of improving operations and profitability. This strategy requires active management and a deep understanding of the company's challenges and opportunities. Successful turnaround investments can yield significant returns as the company recovers and grows.

### Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)
The Time-Weighted Rate of Return is a method that measures the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. TWRR eliminates the impact of cash flows, providing a more accurate reflection of the portfolio manager's performance. This metric is useful for comparing the performance of different investment strategies or funds.

### Volatility
Volatility is the degree of variation in a trading price series over time. High volatility indicates significant price fluctuations, while low volatility suggests stable prices. Understanding volatility helps investors assess the risk associated with different assets and make informed investment decisions.
