## 27.3 Types of Sell-Side Firms

In the Canadian financial landscape, sell-side firms play a crucial role in facilitating transactions, providing market insights, and offering a range of services to institutional and retail clients. Understanding the different types of sell-side firms is essential for anyone involved in the securities industry. This section delves into the classification of investment dealers into full-service dealers, investment banking boutiques, and self-directed dealers, highlighting their services, market focus, and competitive positioning.

### Classification of Sell-Side Firms

Sell-side firms can be broadly categorized into three main types: full-service dealers, investment banking boutiques, and self-directed dealers. Each type serves distinct client needs and operates with unique business models.

#### Full-Service Dealers

**Definition:** Full-service dealers are firms that offer a comprehensive range of capital markets services, including trading, research, advisory, and wealth management.

**Services and Market Focus:**
- **Trading and Execution:** Full-service dealers provide execution services across various asset classes, including equities, fixed income, and derivatives.
- **Research and Analysis:** These firms offer in-depth market research and analysis, helping clients make informed investment decisions.
- **Advisory Services:** They provide corporate finance advisory, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), restructuring, and capital raising.
- **Wealth Management:** Full-service dealers often have dedicated wealth management divisions catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients.

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Full-service dealers compete on the breadth and depth of their service offerings.
- They typically have a large client base, including institutional investors, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals.
- Their competitive advantage lies in their ability to provide integrated solutions and personalized services.

**Example:** Major Canadian banks like RBC Dominion Securities and TD Securities are prominent full-service dealers, offering a wide array of services to their clients.

#### Investment Banking Boutiques

**Definition:** Investment banking boutiques are specialized firms focusing on specific sectors or services, often providing tailored advisory and capital markets services.

**Services and Market Focus:**
- **Sector Specialization:** These firms often specialize in particular industries, such as technology, healthcare, or natural resources.
- **Advisory Services:** They provide specialized advisory services, including M&A, capital raising, and strategic consulting.

- Their competitive edge is their agility and ability to offer bespoke solutions.

**Example:** Firms like Canaccord Genuity and GMP Securities are examples of investment banking boutiques in Canada, known for their expertise in specific sectors.

#### Self-Directed Dealers

**Definition:** Self-directed dealers, also known as discount brokers, primarily offer trade execution services at reduced costs, catering to retail investors who prefer to manage their own investments.

**Services and Market Focus:**
- **Trade Execution:** Self-directed dealers provide platforms for clients to execute trades in equities, mutual funds, ETFs, and other securities.
- **Online Platforms:** They offer user-friendly online trading platforms with tools for research and analysis.
- **Low-Cost Services:** These firms focus on providing cost-effective trading solutions without advisory services.

**Competitive Positioning:**
