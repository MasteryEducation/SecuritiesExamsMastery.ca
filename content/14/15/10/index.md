This section delves into the core functions of equity sales and trading departments, the roles of key personnel, and the intricacies of program trading, structured finance, and derivatives within equity trading.

### Core Functions of Equity Sales and Trading Departments

3. **Advisory Services:** Offering insights and recommendations to institutional clients based on market trends, research, and analysis.
4. **Risk Management:** Managing the risks associated with trading activities, including market, credit, and operational risks.

### Roles within Equity Sales and Trading Departments

Understanding the distinct roles within these departments is crucial for grasping how they function effectively:

- **Client Relationship Management:** Building and nurturing long-term relationships with clients to understand their investment needs and preferences.
- **Market Analysis and Reporting:** Providing clients with timely market updates, research reports, and investment recommendations.
- **Facilitating Transactions:** Coordinating with traders to execute client orders efficiently.

Liability traders manage the dealer’s trading capital to support market making and proprietary trading activities. Their role involves:

- **Capital Management:** Utilizing the dealer's capital to facilitate trades and provide liquidity in the market.
- **Risk Assessment:** Continuously assessing and managing the risks associated with trading positions.
- **Profit Generation:** Identifying opportunities to generate profits through strategic trading and market making.

### Program Trading, Structured Finance, and Derivatives

Equity trading departments often engage in complex trading strategies and financial products, including:

- **Custom Products:** Designing bespoke financial instruments to meet the unique requirements of institutional clients.
