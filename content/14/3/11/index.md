## 15.10 Growth Managers

Growth managers play a pivotal role in equity portfolios by focusing on companies with the potential for significant earnings growth. This section delves into the strategies employed by growth managers, the characteristics of growth stocks, and the inherent risks associated with growth investing. We will also explore Canadian financial regulations and resources that can enhance your understanding of growth management.

### The Role of Growth Managers

Growth managers are investment professionals who specialize in identifying and investing in companies expected to experience above-average growth in earnings. Their primary goal is to achieve capital appreciation by selecting stocks that are poised for significant growth, often reflected in metrics such as Earnings Per Share (EPS).

#### Focus on Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a critical metric for growth managers. It represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Growth managers analyze current and projected EPS to assess a company's growth potential. Companies with rapidly increasing EPS are often attractive to growth managers, as they indicate strong profitability and potential for future expansion.

### Characteristics of Growth Stocks

Growth stocks are typically characterized by their potential for high earnings growth and are often found in sectors such as technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary. These stocks usually exhibit the following traits:

- **Lower Dividend Yields:** Growth stocks often reinvest earnings back into the company rather than paying out dividends. This reinvestment supports further growth and innovation.
- **Higher Valuation Ratios:** Due to their growth potential, these stocks often trade at higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios compared to value stocks. Investors are willing to pay a premium for anticipated future earnings growth.

### Risks Associated with Growth Investing

While growth investing offers the potential for substantial returns, it also comes with significant risks. Understanding these risks is crucial for effective portfolio management.

#### Higher Volatility

Growth stocks tend to be more volatile than their value counterparts. Volatility, a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns, can lead to significant price fluctuations. This volatility is often driven by market sentiment and changes in growth expectations.

#### Sensitivity to Market Cycles

Growth stocks are particularly sensitive to economic cycles. During economic expansions, growth stocks often outperform as investors seek higher returns. However, in economic downturns, these stocks can underperform due to reduced consumer spending and lower growth expectations.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of growth management strategies, consider the following examples:

#### Case Study: Shopify Inc.

Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company, is a prime example of a growth stock. With its innovative platform and expanding market share, Shopify has demonstrated significant EPS growth. Growth managers investing in Shopify have benefited from its rapid expansion and technological advancements.

#### Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), often allocate a portion of their portfolios to growth stocks. By diversifying across sectors and geographies, these funds aim to capture growth opportunities while managing risk.

### Best Practices for Growth Managers

- **Thorough Research:** Conduct comprehensive research to identify companies with strong growth potential. Analyze financial statements, industry trends, and competitive positioning.
- **Diversification:** Diversify across sectors and geographies to mitigate risks associated with individual stocks or market cycles.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly review and adjust portfolios based on changing market conditions and company performance.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Growth managers operating in Canada must adhere to specific financial regulations and leverage available resources to enhance their strategies.

#### Regulatory Framework

The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) oversees securities regulation in Canada. Growth managers must comply with CIRO guidelines to ensure ethical and transparent investment practices.

#### Additional Resources

- **Books:** *"Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits"* by Philip Fisher offers valuable insights into growth investing strategies.
- **Online Resources:** Morningstar's [Growth Investing](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/growth-investing) provides comprehensive analysis and tools for growth investors.

### Conclusion

Growth managers play a crucial role in identifying and capitalizing on opportunities for earnings growth within equity portfolios. By focusing on EPS, understanding the characteristics of growth stocks, and managing associated risks, growth managers can achieve significant capital appreciation. Leveraging Canadian financial regulations and resources further enhances their ability to navigate the dynamic landscape of growth investing.
