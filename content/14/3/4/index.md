## 15.3 Systematic and Non-Systematic Risk

In the realm of investment, understanding the types of risks that can affect a portfolio is crucial for effective portfolio management. This section delves into the concepts of systematic and non-systematic risk, providing insights into their characteristics, impacts, and strategies for mitigation.

### Understanding Systematic Risk

**Systematic Risk**, also known as market risk, refers to the inherent risk that affects the entire market or a specific market segment. This type of risk is unavoidable and is influenced by factors such as economic changes, political events, or natural disasters. Since systematic risk impacts all securities in the market, it cannot be eliminated through diversification.

#### Characteristics of Systematic Risk

- **Market-Wide Impact:** Systematic risk affects all companies and industries, making it a pervasive risk factor.
- **Non-Diversifiable:** Since it is linked to macroeconomic factors, diversification cannot mitigate systematic risk.
- **Examples:** Economic recessions, changes in interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events.

#### Impact on Portfolios

Systematic risk can lead to significant fluctuations in portfolio value. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the global market experienced a downturn, affecting virtually all asset classes. Canadian investors saw declines in their portfolios regardless of the specific securities they held.

### Exploring Non-Systematic Risk

**Non-Systematic Risk**, also known as specific or idiosyncratic risk, is the risk associated with a particular company or industry. Unlike systematic risk, non-systematic risk can be mitigated through diversification.

#### Characteristics of Non-Systematic Risk

- **Asset-Specific:** Non-systematic risk is unique to a particular company or industry.
- **Diversifiable:** By holding a diversified portfolio, investors can reduce exposure to non-systematic risk.
- **Examples:** Company management decisions, product recalls, regulatory changes affecting a specific industry.

#### Impact on Portfolios

Non-systematic risk can lead to volatility in the value of individual securities. For example, if a major Canadian bank like RBC faces a scandal, its stock price might drop significantly, impacting investors who hold a concentrated position in RBC shares.

### Mitigating Non-Systematic Risk Through Diversification

Diversification is a key strategy for managing non-systematic risk. By spreading investments across various asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions, investors can reduce the impact of any single asset's poor performance on the overall portfolio.

#### Strategies for Diversification

1. **Asset Allocation:** Distribute investments across different asset classes such as equities, bonds, and real estate to balance risk and return.
2. **Sector Diversification:** Invest in a variety of sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance) to avoid overexposure to any one industry.
3. **Geographic Diversification:** Include international investments to mitigate risks associated with the Canadian market alone.
4. **Use of Mutual Funds and ETFs:** These instruments inherently provide diversification by pooling funds to invest in a broad range of securities.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: The Impact of Systematic Risk

Consider a Canadian investor with a portfolio heavily weighted in equities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The global market downturn led to a significant decline in stock prices, illustrating the impact of systematic risk that could not be avoided through diversification.

#### Example 2: Mitigating Non-Systematic Risk

A Canadian pension fund diversifies its investments across various sectors and countries. When a major Canadian telecommunications company faces a regulatory issue, the fund's exposure to this specific risk is minimized due to its diversified holdings.

### Visualizing Risk with Diagrams

To better understand the relationship between systematic and non-systematic risk, consider the following diagram:

    A[Total Risk] --> B[Systematic Risk]
    A --> C[Non-Systematic Risk]
    C --> D[Can be Diversified]
    B --> E[Cannot be Diversified]
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practice:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired diversification levels.
- **Common Pitfall:** Overconcentration in a single asset or sector can expose investors to higher non-systematic risk.
