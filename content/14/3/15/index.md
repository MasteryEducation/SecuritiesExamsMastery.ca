## 15.14 Term to Maturity

In the realm of fixed-income investments, understanding the term to maturity is crucial for effective portfolio management. This section delves into the concept of term to maturity, its significance in shaping the risk and return profiles of bonds, and strategies for managing interest rate risk through careful term selection.

### Understanding Term to Maturity

**Term to Maturity** refers to the length of time remaining until a bond's principal is repaid to the investor. It is a fundamental characteristic of bonds that influences their price volatility, yield, and overall risk profile. Bonds can be categorized based on their term to maturity into short-term, medium-term, and long-term bonds.

- **Short-term Bonds:** Typically have maturities of up to 3 years.
- **Medium-term Bonds:** Generally have maturities ranging from 3 to 10 years.
- **Long-term Bonds:** Have maturities exceeding 10 years.

### Significance of Term to Maturity in Fixed-Income Portfolios

The term to maturity is a critical factor in determining a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes, known as **Interest Rate Risk**. As interest rates fluctuate, the market value of bonds adjusts inversely. Longer-term bonds are generally more sensitive to interest rate changes, exhibiting greater price volatility compared to short-term bonds.

#### Risk and Return Profiles

- **Short-term Bonds:** These bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes, offering lower volatility and typically lower yields. They are often used by investors seeking stability and liquidity.
  
- **Medium-term Bonds:** These provide a balance between risk and return, offering moderate yields with moderate sensitivity to interest rate changes.

- **Long-term Bonds:** These are more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, resulting in higher volatility. However, they often offer higher yields, attracting investors willing to accept greater risk for potentially higher returns.

### Managing Interest Rate Risk Through Term Selection

Investors can manage interest rate risk by strategically selecting bonds with varying terms to maturity. This approach helps in diversifying the portfolio and aligning it with the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives.

#### Strategies for Managing Interest Rate Risk

1. **Laddering Strategy:** This involves purchasing bonds with staggered maturities. As bonds mature, the proceeds can be reinvested in new bonds, maintaining a consistent income stream and reducing interest rate risk.

2. **Barbell Strategy:** This strategy combines short-term and long-term bonds, avoiding medium-term bonds. It allows investors to benefit from the stability of short-term bonds while capturing the higher yields of long-term bonds.

3. **Bullet Strategy:** Investors focus on bonds with similar maturities, aligning them with a specific investment horizon. This strategy is useful for meeting future financial obligations.

### Practical Examples of Bond Investments

To illustrate the application of term to maturity in investment decisions, consider the following examples involving Canadian financial instruments:

- **Short-term Investment:** A 2-year Government of Canada bond, offering stability and liquidity with minimal interest rate risk.

- **Medium-term Investment:** A 5-year corporate bond issued by a major Canadian bank like RBC, providing a balance of yield and risk.

- **Long-term Investment:** A 15-year provincial bond, offering higher yields but with increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.

### Visualizing Term to Maturity
