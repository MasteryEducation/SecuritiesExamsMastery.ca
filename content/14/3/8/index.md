## 15.7 Active Investment Management

Active investment management is a dynamic approach to portfolio management where fund managers make specific investments with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index. Unlike passive management, which aims to replicate the performance of a market index, active management involves strategic decisions based on research, analysis, and forecasts. This section delves into the objectives, strategies, and methodologies employed by active managers, particularly within the Canadian financial context.

### Objectives of Active Investment Management

The primary objective of active investment management is to achieve returns that exceed those of a benchmark index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index in Canada. Active managers aim to capitalize on market inefficiencies through:

- **Stock Selection:** Identifying undervalued or overvalued securities to buy or sell.
- **Market Timing:** Making strategic decisions about when to enter or exit the market based on economic forecasts and market trends.

### Strategies for Outperforming Benchmark Indices

Active managers employ various strategies to achieve their objectives, including:

1. **Bottom-Up Analysis:** This approach focuses on analyzing individual securities based on their fundamentals, such as financial statements, management quality, and competitive position. The goal is to identify stocks that are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value.

2. **Top-Down Analysis:** This method begins with macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, and narrows down to specific sectors or securities. It helps managers identify broader economic trends that could impact investment performance.

3. **Sector Rotation:** Involves shifting investments between sectors based on economic cycles. For example, during an economic expansion, managers might favor cyclical sectors like consumer discretionary, while in a downturn, they might shift to defensive sectors like utilities.

4. **Contrarian Investing:** This strategy involves going against prevailing market trends by buying assets that are currently out of favor and selling those that are popular, based on the belief that the market will eventually correct itself.

5. **Event-Driven Strategies:** Focus on exploiting opportunities arising from corporate events such as mergers, acquisitions, or restructurings.

### Practical Examples and Applications

#### Example 1: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds, such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), often employ active management strategies to enhance returns. By leveraging both bottom-up and top-down analyses, they can make informed decisions that align with their long-term investment goals.

#### Example 2: Major Canadian Banks

Banks like RBC and TD utilize active management within their wealth management divisions. For instance, RBC Global Asset Management employs a team of analysts to conduct in-depth research and identify investment opportunities that can outperform the market.
