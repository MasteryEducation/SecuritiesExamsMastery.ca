## 15.21 Glossary for Chapter 15

In this section, we delve into the fundamental terms and concepts that form the backbone of portfolio management. Understanding these terms is crucial for anyone preparing for the Canadian Securities Course (CSC®) and for those looking to enhance their investment acumen. This glossary will provide you with a solid foundation in portfolio management, helping you to navigate the complexities of the financial markets with confidence.

### Portfolio

A **portfolio** is a collection of financial investments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents. The primary goal of a portfolio is to achieve a balance between risk and return, tailored to an investor's financial objectives and risk tolerance. For example, a Canadian investor might hold a diversified portfolio that includes shares of major Canadian banks like RBC and TD, government bonds, and mutual funds.

### Diversification

**Diversification** is a risk management strategy that involves mixing a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind diversification is that a diversified portfolio will, on average, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio. For instance, by investing in both Canadian equities and international stocks, an investor can mitigate the impact of a downturn in the Canadian market.

### Expected Return

The **expected return** is the weighted average of all possible returns from an investment. It is a key concept in portfolio management, helping investors to estimate the potential profitability of their investments. For example, if a portfolio consists of 60% stocks with an expected return of 8% and 40% bonds with an expected return of 4%, the portfolio's expected return would be 6.4%.

### Risk Management

**Risk management** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and either accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. Effective risk management involves understanding the types of risks an investment might face and developing strategies to minimize their impact. This could include diversifying investments, using hedging strategies, or adjusting asset allocations based on market conditions.

### Risk Tolerance

**Risk tolerance** refers to an investor's ability and willingness to lose some or all of their original investment in exchange for greater potential returns. It is a critical factor in determining an appropriate investment strategy. For example, a young investor with a high risk tolerance might invest heavily in equities, while a retiree with a low risk tolerance might prefer bonds and other fixed-income securities.

### Risk Profile

A **risk profile** is a combination of an investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. It helps in determining the most suitable investment strategy for an individual. A risk profile assessment might consider factors such as age, income, investment goals, and time horizon.

### Systematic Risk

**Systematic risk** is the risk inherent to the entire market or market segment. It is also known as market risk and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Examples include economic recessions, political instability, and changes in interest rates. Canadian investors might experience systematic risk through fluctuations in the TSX Composite Index.

### Non-Systematic Risk

**Non-systematic risk** is the risk specific to a single asset or a small group of assets. Unlike systematic risk, it can be mitigated through diversification. For instance, the risk of a major scandal affecting a single company, like a Canadian mining firm, is non-systematic.

### Standard Deviation

**Standard deviation** is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. In finance, it is used to quantify the risk associated with a particular investment or portfolio. A higher standard deviation indicates a higher level of risk. For example, a volatile stock might have a standard deviation of 20%, while a stable bond might have a standard deviation of 5%.

### Beta

**Beta** is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates that it is less volatile. For instance, a Canadian technology stock with a beta of 1.5 would be expected to move 1.5 times the market's movements.

### Weighted Average Return

The **weighted average return** is the average return of a portfolio, weighted by the proportion of each asset in the portfolio. It provides a more accurate picture of a portfolio's performance than a simple average. For example, if 70% of a portfolio is invested in equities with a return of 10% and 30% in bonds with a return of 5%, the weighted average return would be 8.5%.

### Correlation

**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two securities move in relation to each other. A correlation of 1 indicates that the securities move perfectly in sync, while a correlation of -1 indicates that they move in opposite directions. Understanding correlation helps investors in constructing diversified portfolios. For example, Canadian equities and commodities might have a low correlation, providing diversification benefits.

### Active Management

**Active management** is a strategy where portfolio managers make specific investments with the goal of outperforming an investment benchmark index. This involves frequent buying and selling of assets and requires a deep understanding of market trends and individual securities. For example, an actively managed Canadian equity fund might aim to outperform the S&P/TSX Composite Index.

### Passive Management

**Passive management** is a strategy that seeks to replicate the performance of a specific benchmark index. This involves minimal buying and selling, aiming to match the index's returns. A common example is an index fund that tracks the S&P/TSX 60 Index, providing exposure to the largest companies in Canada.

### Growth Investing

**Growth investing** is a strategy focused on companies that exhibit signs of above-average growth, even if the stock appears expensive in terms of metrics. Growth investors look for companies with strong earnings growth potential. For instance, investing in Canadian technology firms with innovative products and services might be considered a growth investing strategy.

### Value Investing

**Value investing** is a strategy focused on picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors seek out undervalued companies with strong fundamentals. An example might be investing in a Canadian energy company that is undervalued due to temporary market conditions.

### Sector Rotation

**Sector rotation** is an investment strategy that involves shifting the portfolio into different industry sectors based on the current economic cycle. This strategy aims to capitalize on the performance of sectors that are expected to outperform during specific phases of the economic cycle. For example, during an economic expansion, an investor might rotate into cyclical sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials.

### Term to Maturity

The **term to maturity** is the length of time until a bond's principal is repaid. It is an important factor in determining a bond's interest rate risk and yield. For instance, a Canadian government bond with a 10-year term to maturity will have different risk and return characteristics compared to a 2-year bond.

### Credit Quality

**Credit quality** refers to a bond's capacity to meet its financial commitments. It is assessed by credit rating agencies and affects the bond's yield and risk. Higher credit quality bonds, such as those issued by the Canadian government, typically offer lower yields but are considered safer investments.

### Interest Rate Anticipation

**Interest rate anticipation** is a strategy that adjusts the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes based on predicted movements. Investors might increase their holdings in short-term bonds if they anticipate rising interest rates, as these are less sensitive to rate changes.

### Asset Allocation

**Asset allocation** is the process of dividing a portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, to optimize risk and return. It is a key component of a successful investment strategy. For example, a balanced Canadian portfolio might allocate 60% to equities, 30% to bonds, and 10% to cash.

### Duration

**Duration** is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates. It is expressed in years and helps investors understand how much a bond's price might change with interest rate fluctuations. A bond with a duration of 5 years would see its price decrease by approximately 5% if interest rates rise by 1%.

### Duration Switching

**Duration switching** involves adjusting the portfolio's average duration based on interest rate forecasts. This strategy aims to manage interest rate risk by increasing duration when rates are expected to fall and decreasing duration when rates are expected to rise.

### Active Investment Management

**Active investment management** is a management style aiming to outperform market indices through strategic investment choices. It involves frequent trading and requires a deep understanding of market trends and individual securities.

### Passive Investment Management

**Passive investment management** is a management style aiming to match the performance of a market index without attempting to outperform it. This approach involves minimal trading and is often implemented through index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

### Alpha

**Alpha** is the excess return of a portfolio relative to the return predicted by its beta. It is a measure of a portfolio manager's ability to generate returns above the market benchmark. A positive alpha indicates outperformance, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance.
