## 25.3 Disadvantages of Fee-Based Accounts

Fee-based accounts have become increasingly popular in the financial services industry, offering a model where clients pay a set fee for advisory services rather than commissions on individual transactions. While this structure can align the interests of advisors and clients, it is crucial to understand the potential disadvantages that may arise. This section delves into the drawbacks of fee-based accounts, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Potential for Higher Overall Costs

One of the primary concerns with fee-based accounts is the potential for higher overall costs compared to commission-based accounts. This is particularly true for buy-and-hold investors who engage in fewer transactions. In a fee-based model, clients are charged a percentage of their assets under management (AUM), regardless of the number of trades executed. For investors who prefer a passive investment strategy, the cumulative fees over time can outweigh the costs of paying commissions on occasional trades.

#### Example: Comparing Costs

Consider an investor with a $500,000 portfolio who makes only a few trades annually. In a commission-based account, they might pay $100 per trade, resulting in $300 in annual trading costs. In contrast, a fee-based account charging 1% of AUM would cost $5,000 annually, significantly higher than the commission-based alternative.

### Limitations on the Number of Trades

Some fee-based accounts impose restrictions on the number of trades allowed within a given period. These limitations can hinder active traders who wish to capitalize on market opportunities. While the fee-based model is designed to reduce the incentive for excessive trading, it may inadvertently restrict investors who require flexibility in their trading strategies.

### Risk of Account Neglect

Despite the ongoing fee structure, there is a risk of account neglect. Advisors may become complacent, knowing they receive a steady income regardless of the level of service provided. While the fee-based model incentivizes maintaining client satisfaction to retain business, it does not guarantee proactive account management. Clients should ensure that their advisors are actively managing their portfolios and providing regular updates and insights.

### Possibility of Additional Hidden Fees

Fee-based accounts can also include additional hidden fees, such as trailer fees on mutual funds and structured products. Trailer fees are ongoing commissions paid to advisors based on the assets under management. These fees can erode investment returns over time, particularly if they are not transparently disclosed to clients.

#### Glossary: Trailer Fees

- **Trailer Fees:** Ongoing commissions paid to advisors based on the assets under management. These fees are typically embedded in the management expense ratio (MER) of mutual funds and can reduce the overall returns for investors.

### Practical Example: Hidden Fees in Action

Imagine an investor who holds a significant portion of their portfolio in mutual funds. If these funds carry a 1% trailer fee, the investor may unknowingly pay an additional $5,000 annually on a $500,000 portfolio, reducing their net returns.

### Best Practices and Strategies

To mitigate these disadvantages, investors should:

1. **Conduct Thorough Research:** Understand the fee structure and any potential hidden costs associated with fee-based accounts.
2. **Evaluate Investment Strategies:** Consider whether a fee-based account aligns with your investment strategy, particularly if you are a buy-and-hold investor.
3. **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly review account statements and performance reports to ensure active management and transparency.
4. **Communicate with Advisors:** Maintain open communication with your advisor to ensure your investment goals and expectations are being met.

### Conclusion

While fee-based accounts offer a transparent and potentially more aligned fee structure, they are not without their drawbacks. Understanding the potential for higher costs, trade limitations, account neglect, and hidden fees is crucial for making informed investment decisions. By staying informed and proactive, investors can navigate these challenges and optimize their financial strategies.
