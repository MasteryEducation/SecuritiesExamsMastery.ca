## 25.16 Full-Service Brokerage Accounts

Full-service brokerage accounts are a cornerstone of personalized investment management, offering clients a comprehensive suite of financial services. These accounts are designed to cater to investors who seek more than just basic trading capabilities, providing a holistic approach to financial planning and investment management. In this section, we will delve into the features, fee structures, and service tiers of full-service brokerage accounts, with a focus on the Canadian financial landscape.

### Understanding Full-Service Brokerage Accounts

Full-service brokerage accounts are investment accounts that offer a wide range of services beyond simple trade execution. These accounts typically include:

- **Comprehensive Financial Planning:** Advisors work with clients to develop personalized financial plans that align with their long-term goals, such as retirement planning, tax optimization, and estate planning.
- **Investment Management:** Professional portfolio management services are provided, often including asset allocation, diversification strategies, and regular portfolio reviews.
- **Research and Insights:** Clients have access to in-depth market research, analysis, and investment recommendations from experienced financial analysts.
- **Trading Services:** Unlimited trading capabilities are often included, allowing clients to buy and sell securities without incurring additional transaction fees.

### Fee Structures

The fee structures for full-service brokerage accounts are generally based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM), account size, and the level of services provided. This model aligns the interests of the advisor and the client, as both parties benefit from the growth of the client's portfolio. Common fee structures include:

- **Percentage of AUM:** Typically ranging from 1% to 2% annually, this fee is calculated based on the total value of the assets managed within the account.
- **Flat Fees:** Some firms may offer a flat annual fee for their services, which can be advantageous for clients with larger portfolios.
- **Tiered Pricing:** Fees may decrease as the account size increases, providing an incentive for clients to consolidate their assets with a single brokerage.

### Service Tiers

Investment dealers often offer different service tiers to cater to the varying needs of their clients. These tiers can range from basic to premium services, with each level offering a different set of features and benefits:

- **Basic Tier:** Includes essential services such as financial planning and access to research reports. This tier is suitable for clients who require foundational support and guidance.
- **Intermediate Tier:** Offers enhanced services, including more frequent portfolio reviews and personalized investment strategies. Clients in this tier may also receive invitations to exclusive seminars and events.
- **Premium Tier:** Provides the highest level of service, including dedicated financial advisors, bespoke investment solutions, and priority access to new investment opportunities. This tier is ideal for high-net-worth individuals seeking a tailored approach to wealth management.

### Practical Example: Canadian Brokerage Firms

Consider a client working with RBC Direct Investing, a major Canadian brokerage firm. The client opts for a full-service brokerage account with a 1.5% annual fee based on AUM. With a portfolio valued at $500,000, the client pays $7,500 annually for comprehensive financial planning, investment management, and unlimited trading services. The client benefits from personalized advice, regular portfolio reviews, and access to RBC's extensive market research.

### Case Study: Maximizing Benefits

A case study involving TD Direct Investing illustrates how a client can maximize the benefits of a full-service brokerage account. By consolidating assets into a single account, the client reduces overall fees through tiered pricing. The client works closely with a dedicated advisor to develop a tax-efficient investment strategy, leveraging TD's research to identify growth opportunities in the Canadian market. This strategic approach results in a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with the client's long-term financial goals.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
