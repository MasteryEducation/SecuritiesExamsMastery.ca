## 25.5 Types of Managed Fee-Based Accounts

In the evolving landscape of wealth management, managed fee-based accounts have emerged as a popular choice for investors seeking professional management and strategic asset allocation. This section delves into the various types of managed fee-based accounts, including ETF wraps, mutual fund wraps, advisor-managed accounts, and separately managed accounts. We will explore their customization levels, investment management approaches, and how they cater to different client needs and asset sizes.

### ETF Wraps

**Definition:** ETF wraps are managed accounts that hold a basket of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tailored to specific investment strategies. These accounts are designed to provide diversified exposure across various asset classes while leveraging the cost-effectiveness and liquidity of ETFs.

**Customization and Management:** ETF wraps offer a moderate level of customization. The portfolio manager selects ETFs based on the client's risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook. The use of ETFs allows for efficient rebalancing and tax management, making them suitable for clients seeking a hands-off investment approach with broad market exposure.

**Client Needs and Asset Sizes:** ETF wraps are ideal for clients with moderate to large asset sizes who desire a diversified portfolio without the complexities of individual security selection. They cater to investors looking for cost-effective management and transparency in their holdings.

**Example:** A Canadian investor with a $500,000 portfolio might choose an ETF wrap that includes a mix of Canadian equity ETFs, international equity ETFs, and fixed-income ETFs. This strategy provides exposure to global markets while maintaining a focus on cost efficiency.

### Mutual Fund Wraps

**Definition:** Mutual fund wraps are managed accounts containing a selection of mutual funds, overseen by an overlay manager. The manager is responsible for selecting and monitoring the mutual funds to align with the client's investment objectives.

**Customization and Management:** Mutual fund wraps offer a higher level of customization compared to ETF wraps. The overlay manager actively selects mutual funds based on performance, management style, and alignment with the client's goals. This approach allows for dynamic asset allocation and the potential for higher returns through active management.

**Client Needs and Asset Sizes:** These accounts are suitable for clients with larger asset sizes who seek active management and are willing to pay higher fees for the potential of enhanced returns. They cater to investors who prefer a more personalized investment strategy with professional oversight.

**Example:** A high-net-worth individual with a $1 million portfolio might opt for a mutual fund wrap that includes a mix of growth-oriented and income-focused mutual funds. The overlay manager adjusts the fund selection based on market conditions and the client's changing financial goals.

### Advisor-Managed Accounts

**Definition:** Advisor-managed accounts are personalized investment portfolios managed directly by a financial advisor. The advisor has discretion over the investment decisions, tailoring the portfolio to meet the specific needs and preferences of the client.

**Customization and Management:** These accounts offer the highest level of customization. The advisor works closely with the client to understand their financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment objectives. The advisor actively manages the portfolio, making adjustments as needed to align with the client's goals.

**Client Needs and Asset Sizes:** Advisor-managed accounts are best suited for clients with significant assets who require a tailored investment strategy and direct communication with their advisor. They are ideal for investors who value a personalized approach and are willing to pay for the advisor's expertise and attention.

**Example:** A retiree with a $2 million portfolio might engage an advisor to manage their account, focusing on income generation and capital preservation. The advisor selects individual securities and adjusts the asset allocation to ensure the portfolio meets the retiree's income needs and risk profile.

### Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)

**Definition:** Separately managed accounts (SMAs) are individual investment accounts managed by professional asset managers. Unlike mutual funds, SMAs provide direct ownership of the securities within the account, allowing for greater customization and tax efficiency.

**Customization and Management:** SMAs offer a high degree of customization, similar to advisor-managed accounts. The asset manager constructs a portfolio tailored to the client's specific requirements, considering factors such as tax implications and ethical investment preferences.

**Client Needs and Asset Sizes:** SMAs are designed for high-net-worth individuals who seek personalized investment solutions and direct ownership of securities. They cater to clients who prioritize tax efficiency and customization in their investment strategy.

**Example:** A business owner with a $5 million portfolio might choose an SMA to implement a tax-efficient investment strategy. The asset manager selects individual securities and employs tax-loss harvesting techniques to minimize the client's tax liability.

To better understand the differences between these account types, let's compare their key features in a table:
