## 25.6 Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Wraps

Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) wraps are a popular investment vehicle that combines the benefits of ETFs with the expertise of professional management. In this section, we will explore the structure of ETF wrap accounts, distinguish between passive and active management approaches, and highlight the advantages of using ETF wraps in investment portfolios.

### Understanding ETF Wrap Accounts

ETF wrap accounts are managed investment portfolios that primarily consist of ETFs. These accounts are designed to provide investors with a diversified portfolio managed by financial professionals. The structure of an ETF wrap account typically involves a financial advisor or a portfolio manager who selects a range of ETFs to meet the investor's financial goals and risk tolerance.

#### Structure of ETF Wrap Accounts

1. **Portfolio Construction:** The portfolio manager constructs a diversified portfolio using a selection of ETFs. These ETFs can cover various asset classes, including equities, fixed income, commodities, and international markets.

2. **Ongoing Management:** The portfolio manager continuously monitors and adjusts the portfolio to align with the investor's objectives and market conditions. This may involve rebalancing the portfolio to maintain the desired asset allocation.

3. **Fee Structure:** ETF wrap accounts typically charge a management fee, which is a percentage of the assets under management. This fee covers the cost of portfolio management and advisory services.

4. **Reporting and Transparency:** Investors receive regular reports detailing the performance of their portfolio, the underlying holdings, and any changes made by the portfolio manager.

### Passive vs. Active Management in ETF Wraps

ETF wraps can be managed using either a passive or active approach, each with its own set of strategies and objectives.

#### Passive Management Approach

The passive approach aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index with minimal trading. This strategy involves selecting ETFs that track broad market indices, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index in Canada. The key characteristics of passive management include:

- **Low Turnover:** Minimal trading activity, resulting in lower transaction costs.
- **Market Exposure:** Provides broad market exposure, capturing the overall market performance.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Generally lower management fees compared to active strategies.

#### Active Management Approach

In contrast, the active approach involves frequent trading with the goal of outperforming market indices. Portfolio managers actively select ETFs based on market analysis, economic forecasts, and investment opportunities. Key characteristics of active management include:

- **Higher Turnover:** Frequent buying and selling of ETFs to capitalize on market trends.
- **Potential for Outperformance:** Aims to achieve returns above the market average.
- **Higher Costs:** Typically involves higher management fees due to increased trading activity.

### Advantages of ETF Wraps

ETF wraps offer several advantages that make them an attractive option for investors seeking professional management and diversification.

1. **Low Costs:** Compared to traditional mutual funds, ETF wraps often have lower expense ratios due to the cost efficiency of ETFs and the passive management approach.

2. **Expert ETF Selection:** Portfolio managers have the expertise to select a diversified mix of ETFs that align with the investor's goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

3. **Standardized Asset Allocation Models:** ETF wraps provide standardized asset allocation models, allowing investors to choose a portfolio that matches their investment objectives.

4. **Diversification:** By investing in a range of ETFs, investors gain exposure to various asset classes and geographic regions, reducing the risk associated with individual securities.

5. **Transparency:** Investors have access to detailed reports on the portfolio's performance, holdings, and any changes made by the manager, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Fund Strategy

Consider a Canadian pension fund that utilizes an ETF wrap account to manage its investment portfolio. The fund's objective is to achieve steady growth while minimizing risk. The portfolio manager selects a mix of ETFs that track Canadian equities, international equities, and fixed income indices. By using a passive management approach, the fund benefits from low costs and broad market exposure. The portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain the desired asset allocation, ensuring alignment with the fund's long-term goals.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

**Best Practices:**

- **Regular Review:** Investors should regularly review their ETF wrap accounts to ensure alignment with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
- **Understand Fees:** Be aware of the fee structure and how it impacts overall returns.
- **Diversification:** Ensure the portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and regions.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **Overlooking Costs:** Failing to consider the impact of management fees on net returns.
- **Ignoring Rebalancing Needs:** Neglecting to rebalance the portfolio can lead to unintended risk exposure.
- **Misalignment with Goals:** Choosing an ETF wrap that does not align with the investor's financial objectives.
