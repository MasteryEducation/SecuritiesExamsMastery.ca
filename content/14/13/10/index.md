## 25.9 Separately Managed Accounts (SMA)

Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) represent a sophisticated investment vehicle that offers personalized investment management tailored to the specific needs and objectives of individual investors. In the Canadian financial landscape, SMAs are increasingly popular among high-net-worth individuals seeking bespoke investment solutions. This section delves into the intricacies of SMAs, highlighting their benefits, customization capabilities, tax efficiency, and the strategic advantages they offer through access to dedicated portfolio managers.

### Understanding Separately Managed Accounts

An SMA is a portfolio of assets managed by a professional investment manager on behalf of an individual investor. Unlike mutual funds, where investors pool their money, SMAs provide direct ownership of securities, allowing for greater customization and control over investment decisions. This structure is particularly appealing to investors who desire a tailored approach to asset management.

### Benefits of Holding Assets Separately

#### Customization

One of the primary advantages of SMAs is the ability to customize investment strategies to align with the investor's specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and preferences. This customization extends to asset selection, sector allocation, and even ethical considerations, such as excluding certain industries or companies from the portfolio.

#### Tax Efficiency

SMAs offer significant tax efficiency benefits. Since investors directly own the underlying securities, they can manage capital gains and losses more effectively. This direct ownership allows for strategic tax-loss harvesting, where losses can be used to offset gains, thereby minimizing taxable income. Additionally, investors can control the timing of capital gains realization, optimizing their tax situation.

### Advantages of SMAs

#### Access to Dedicated Portfolio Managers

Investors in SMAs benefit from the expertise of dedicated portfolio managers who actively manage the account. These professionals tailor investment strategies to meet the unique needs of each client, providing personalized advice and insights. This relationship fosters a deeper understanding of the investor's financial objectives and allows for proactive adjustments to the portfolio as market conditions change.

#### Tailored Investment Strategies

SMAs offer the flexibility to implement sophisticated investment strategies that may not be feasible in pooled investment vehicles. For example, a portfolio manager can employ specific hedging techniques, sector rotations, or thematic investing based on the investor's preferences and market outlook. This level of customization ensures that the investment strategy is aligned with the investor's long-term goals.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Fund Strategy

Consider a Canadian pension fund that opts for an SMA to manage its assets. The fund's investment committee works closely with a dedicated portfolio manager to develop a strategy that focuses on sustainable investments. The manager selects a mix of Canadian equities and fixed-income securities that align with the fund's ethical guidelines, while also employing tax-efficient strategies to maximize after-tax returns. This approach not only meets the fund's financial objectives but also adheres to its commitment to responsible investing.

### Real-World Scenario: Major Canadian Bank

A high-net-worth client of a major Canadian bank, such as RBC or TD, might choose an SMA to achieve a specific investment outcome. The client works with a portfolio manager to create a diversified portfolio that includes Canadian and international equities, bonds, and alternative investments. The manager actively monitors the portfolio, making adjustments to capitalize on market opportunities and manage risk. This hands-on approach ensures that the client's investment strategy remains aligned with their evolving financial goals.
