## 25.15 Non-Managed Fee-Based Accounts

In the realm of investment and financial planning, understanding the nuances of different account types is crucial for both investors and financial professionals. Non-managed fee-based accounts represent a significant category within this spectrum, offering unique benefits and considerations. This section delves into the definition, differentiation, and key features of non-managed fee-based accounts, providing a comprehensive overview for those navigating the Canadian financial landscape.

### Definition and Differentiation

**Non-Managed Fee-Based Accounts** are investment accounts where clients receive financial planning and trading services without the discretionary management of their assets by a financial advisor. Unlike managed accounts, where investment decisions are made by a portfolio manager on behalf of the client, non-managed accounts require the client to be actively involved in the decision-making process.

#### Key Differences from Managed Accounts

1. **Decision-Making Authority**: In non-managed accounts, clients retain control over investment decisions, whereas managed accounts involve a portfolio manager making decisions on behalf of the client.

2. **Fee Structure**: Non-managed accounts typically charge a flat fee or a percentage of assets under management (AUM) for advisory services, rather than transaction-based commissions. Managed accounts may have additional fees for active management.

3. **Level of Service**: Managed accounts often include comprehensive portfolio management services, while non-managed accounts focus on providing advice and execution services without direct management.

### Overview of Account Types

Non-managed fee-based accounts can be broadly categorized into two types: full-service brokerage accounts and self-directed brokerage accounts. Each type caters to different client needs and investment preferences.

#### Full-Service Brokerage Accounts

Full-service brokerage accounts offer a wide range of services, including investment advice, research, and personalized financial planning. These accounts are ideal for clients who seek professional guidance but prefer to make their own investment decisions.

- **Key Features**:
  - Access to a dedicated financial advisor.
  - Comprehensive financial planning and investment advice.
  - Research and analysis tools to aid decision-making.
  - A fee structure based on AUM or a flat fee, rather than per transaction.

- **Target Client Base**:
  - Investors who value professional advice but want to maintain control over their investment choices.
  - Individuals seeking a collaborative approach to financial planning.

#### Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts

Self-directed brokerage accounts empower clients to manage their own investments with minimal intervention from financial advisors. These accounts are suited for knowledgeable investors who prefer a hands-on approach.

- **Key Features**:
  - Direct access to trading platforms and investment tools.
  - Lower fees compared to full-service accounts, often with no advisory fees.
  - Flexibility to execute trades and manage portfolios independently.

- **Target Client Base**:
  - Experienced investors comfortable with making their own investment decisions.
  - Individuals seeking cost-effective investment solutions.

### Practical Financial Examples and Case Studies

To illustrate the application of non-managed fee-based accounts, consider the following scenarios:

#### Example 1: Full-Service Brokerage Account

Sarah, a Canadian investor, prefers to make her own investment decisions but values the insights of a financial advisor. She opts for a full-service brokerage account with RBC Dominion Securities, where she receives personalized advice and access to research reports. Sarah pays an annual fee based on her portfolio's value, allowing her to focus on long-term growth without worrying about transaction costs.

#### Example 2: Self-Directed Brokerage Account

John, an experienced investor, chooses a self-directed brokerage account with TD Direct Investing. He enjoys the autonomy to trade stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds using TD's online platform. With no advisory fees, John benefits from lower costs and the flexibility to implement his own investment strategies.
