## 25.14 Documentation and Regulation for Managed Accounts

Managed accounts are a pivotal component of the financial services landscape, offering personalized investment management tailored to individual client needs. This section delves into the critical documentation and regulatory frameworks governing managed accounts in Canada, with a focus on the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) guidelines. Understanding these elements is essential for financial professionals to ensure compliance and deliver optimal service to clients.

### Overview of Necessary Documentation

The foundation of any managed account is the **Managed Account Agreement**. This legal document outlines the terms and conditions under which the account is managed, including:

- **Investment Objectives and Strategies:** Clearly defined goals and the strategies employed to achieve them.
- **Fees and Compensation:** Detailed information on management fees, performance fees, and any other charges.
- **Risk Disclosure:** Comprehensive disclosure of the risks associated with the investment strategies.
- **Authority and Responsibilities:** The scope of authority granted to the portfolio manager and the responsibilities of both parties.
- **Termination Clauses:** Conditions under which the agreement can be terminated by either party.

These agreements must be meticulously drafted to ensure clarity and mutual understanding between the client and the investment manager.

### Regulatory Requirements under IIROC Guidelines

IIROC plays a crucial role in regulating managed accounts, ensuring that investment dealers adhere to high standards of conduct. Key regulatory requirements include:

- **Registration and Licensing:** Portfolio managers must be registered with IIROC and possess the necessary qualifications.
- **Know Your Client (KYC) and Suitability Obligations:** Firms must gather comprehensive information about the client's financial situation, investment knowledge, and risk tolerance to ensure suitable investment recommendations.
- **Performance Reporting:** Regular and transparent reporting of account performance to clients, including benchmark comparisons.
- **Conflict of Interest Management:** Policies to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, ensuring client interests are prioritized.

The lifecycle of a managed account involves several critical procedures:

1. **Approval Process:**

- **Continuous Education:** Engaging in professional development and training on regulatory updates.
