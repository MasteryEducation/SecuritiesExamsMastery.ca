## 25.10 Single-Mandate Separately Managed Accounts

Single-Mandate Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) represent a tailored investment approach where a portfolio is managed under a specific investment mandate by a dedicated portfolio manager or team. This section delves into the nuances of single-mandate SMAs, highlighting their structure, benefits, and challenges, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Understanding Single-Mandate SMAs

Single-Mandate SMAs are investment accounts managed according to a specific investment strategy or objective. Unlike multi-mandate accounts, which may involve multiple strategies or objectives, single-mandate SMAs focus on a singular approach, providing clarity and precision in investment management.

#### Key Features

- **Directed by a Single Portfolio Manager or Team:** The management of single-mandate SMAs is typically entrusted to a single portfolio manager or a cohesive team, ensuring a unified investment strategy.
- **Security Selection:** The portfolio manager selects securities that align with the mandate's objectives, whether it's growth, income, or a specific sector focus.
- **Sector Investment:** Investments may be concentrated in particular sectors to capitalize on market trends or economic conditions.
- **Optimal Asset Allocation:** The manager strategically allocates assets to optimize returns while managing risk, adhering to the mandate's guidelines.

### Advantages of Single-Mandate SMAs

Single-mandate SMAs offer several advantages, making them an attractive option for investors seeking specialized investment management.

#### Access to Sophisticated Portfolio Managers

Investors benefit from the expertise of seasoned portfolio managers who bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. These professionals employ advanced analytical tools and strategies to enhance portfolio performance.

#### Tax Loss Selling

Single-mandate SMAs provide opportunities for tax loss selling, a strategy where underperforming securities are sold to realize losses that can offset capital gains. This can be particularly advantageous in the Canadian context, where tax efficiency is a critical consideration for investors.

#### Customization and Control

Investors enjoy a high degree of customization and control over their portfolios. The single-mandate approach allows for precise alignment with the investor's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

### Challenges of Managing Single-Mandate SMAs

Despite their benefits, single-mandate SMAs present certain challenges, particularly when managing multiple accounts with diverse investment objectives.

#### Complexity in Managing Multiple Mandates

For investors with multiple single-mandate SMAs, managing the interplay between different mandates can be complex. Each account may have distinct objectives, requiring careful coordination to ensure overall portfolio coherence.

#### Potential for Over-Concentration

Focusing on a single mandate can lead to over-concentration in specific sectors or asset classes, increasing exposure to sector-specific risks. Portfolio managers must balance the mandate's focus with diversification to mitigate these risks.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Fund Strategy

Consider a Canadian pension fund that employs single-mandate SMAs to manage its equity investments. The fund allocates a portion of its assets to a single-mandate SMA focused on Canadian technology stocks, managed by a team specializing in this sector. The portfolio manager selects high-growth technology companies, leveraging their expertise to optimize returns while managing sector-specific risks.
