## Glossary for Chapter 25: Fee-Based Accounts

In Chapter 25, we delve into the world of fee-based accounts, a pivotal component of modern investment strategies. This glossary serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the key terms and concepts associated with fee-based accounts, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape. By familiarizing yourself with these terms, you'll gain a deeper insight into how fee-based accounts operate and their advantages over traditional commission-based models.

### Discretionary Accounts

**Definition:** Discretionary accounts are investment accounts where the portfolio manager has the authority to make investment decisions without requiring prior client approval for each transaction.

**Explanation:** In discretionary accounts, clients entrust their portfolio managers with the authority to make investment decisions on their behalf. This arrangement is particularly beneficial for clients who prefer a hands-off approach to investing or lack the time to manage their portfolios actively. Portfolio managers leverage their expertise to make timely decisions, aiming to optimize returns based on the client's investment objectives and risk tolerance.

**Example:** A Canadian investor with a discretionary account at RBC Wealth Management allows their portfolio manager to adjust the asset allocation in response to market conditions, such as increasing exposure to Canadian equities during a market upswing.

### Mutual Fund Wraps

**Definition:** Mutual fund wraps are managed accounts that hold a selection of mutual funds, overseen by an overlay manager who manages asset allocation and fund selection.

**Explanation:** Mutual fund wraps offer investors a diversified portfolio of mutual funds tailored to specific investment goals. The overlay manager is responsible for selecting the funds and adjusting the asset allocation to align with the client's objectives. This approach provides investors with professional management and diversification across multiple asset classes.

**Example:** A mutual fund wrap account at TD Wealth might include a mix of Canadian equity funds, international equity funds, and fixed-income funds, with the overlay manager adjusting the allocation based on market trends and economic forecasts.

### Exchange-Traded Fund Wraps

**Definition:** Exchange-traded fund (ETF) wraps are managed accounts comprising a basket of ETFs tailored to specific investment strategies, managed actively or passively.

**Explanation:** ETF wraps provide investors with a cost-effective way to access a diversified portfolio of ETFs. These accounts can be managed actively, with frequent adjustments to the ETF selection, or passively, following a set strategy. ETF wraps are popular for their transparency, liquidity, and lower fees compared to mutual funds.

**Example:** An ETF wrap account at BMO Nesbitt Burns might focus on a passive strategy, holding a mix of Canadian and U.S. equity ETFs to track major indices, while an active strategy might involve tactical shifts in sector-specific ETFs.

### Overlay Manager

**Definition:** An overlay manager is a portfolio manager responsible for the overall strategy, asset allocation, and management of a mutual fund or ETF wrap account.

**Explanation:** The overlay manager plays a crucial role in ensuring that the investment strategy aligns with the client's objectives. They oversee the selection of underlying funds or ETFs and make strategic adjustments to the portfolio to optimize performance. Overlay managers bring a holistic view to portfolio management, considering factors such as market trends, economic indicators, and client preferences.

**Example:** An overlay manager at CIBC Wood Gundy might decide to increase the allocation to technology sector ETFs in response to strong earnings reports and positive industry outlooks.

### Fee-Based Accounts

**Definition:** Fee-based accounts are investment accounts where advisors earn fees based on assets under management rather than commissions from product sales.

**Explanation:** Fee-based accounts align the interests of advisors and clients by focusing on the growth of the client's portfolio. Advisors charge a percentage of the assets under management, incentivizing them to prioritize the client's financial success. This model reduces conflicts of interest associated with commission-based sales and provides clients with transparent and predictable costs.

**Example:** A fee-based account at Scotiabank charges an annual fee of 1% of the assets under management, providing clients with comprehensive financial planning and investment management services.

### Private Family Office

**Definition:** A private family office is a dedicated team managing all financial and personal affairs of a high-net-worth family, offering comprehensive services.

**Explanation:** Private family offices cater to the complex needs of high-net-worth families, providing services such as investment management, tax planning, estate planning, and philanthropy. These offices offer personalized solutions and a high level of confidentiality, ensuring that the family's financial and personal goals are met.

**Example:** A Canadian family with significant wealth might establish a private family office to manage their investments, coordinate charitable activities, and plan for intergenerational wealth transfer.

### Household Account

**Definition:** Household accounts coordinate investment holdings and strategies across multiple family members for optimized management.

**Explanation:** Household accounts allow families to consolidate their investment strategies, taking advantage of economies of scale and coordinated financial planning. By managing accounts collectively, families can achieve better diversification, tax efficiency, and alignment with shared financial goals.

**Example:** A household account at National Bank Financial might include individual accounts for parents and children, with a unified strategy focusing on long-term growth and education savings.

### Robo-Advisor

**Definition:** A robo-advisor is an automated investment platform that manages client portfolios using algorithms with minimal human intervention.

**Explanation:** Robo-advisors offer a low-cost, convenient solution for investors seeking professional portfolio management. These platforms use algorithms to create and manage diversified portfolios based on the client's risk tolerance and investment goals. Robo-advisors are ideal for investors who prefer a digital-first approach and are comfortable with technology-driven solutions.

**Example:** Wealthsimple, a popular Canadian robo-advisor, provides clients with a diversified portfolio of ETFs, automatically rebalancing and optimizing the portfolio based on market conditions.

### Managed Accounts

**Definition:** Managed accounts are investment accounts where a portfolio manager makes discretionary investment decisions on behalf of the client.

**Explanation:** Managed accounts offer personalized investment management, with portfolio managers tailoring strategies to meet the client's specific needs. These accounts provide flexibility and customization, allowing for adjustments based on changing market conditions and client preferences.

**Example:** A managed account at Manulife Securities might focus on sustainable investing, with the portfolio manager selecting companies with strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.

### Separately Managed Accounts (SMA)

**Definition:** Separately managed accounts (SMAs) are individual investment accounts managed by professional portfolio managers, allowing for customization and tax efficiency.

**Explanation:** SMAs provide investors with a high degree of customization, as each account is managed separately based on the client's objectives. This structure allows for tailored investment strategies and tax-efficient management, as investors directly own the underlying securities.

**Example:** An SMA at Mackenzie Investments might focus on Canadian dividend-paying stocks, with the portfolio manager selecting securities that align with the client's income and growth objectives.

### Multi-Manager Accounts

**Definition:** Multi-manager accounts incorporate multiple investment mandates or strategies under a unified management approach.

**Explanation:** Multi-manager accounts offer diversification across different investment styles and asset classes by combining the expertise of multiple portfolio managers. This approach provides investors with access to a broad range of strategies, enhancing the potential for risk-adjusted returns.

**Example:** A multi-manager account at Invesco Canada might include mandates focusing on Canadian equities, global fixed income, and alternative investments, each managed by specialized portfolio managers.

### Unified Managed Account (UMA)

**Definition:** A unified managed account (UMA) is a consolidated investment account that combines multiple investment strategies or mandates for streamlined management.

**Explanation:** UMAs offer a comprehensive solution for investors seeking a single account to manage diverse investment strategies. By consolidating multiple mandates, UMAs provide simplified reporting, enhanced tax efficiency, and coordinated portfolio management.

**Example:** A UMA at Raymond James might integrate strategies such as growth investing, income generation, and risk management, providing clients with a holistic investment solution.
