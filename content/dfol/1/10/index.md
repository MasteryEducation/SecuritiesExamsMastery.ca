## 1.10 Who Uses Derivatives and to What Extent Are They Used?

Have you ever walked by a coffee shop, sniffed the aroma, and wondered if the shop owner worries about the price of coffee beans? Or sat in your car at a gas station feeling slightly perplexed at why gas prices bounce around like they’re on a trampoline? These everyday scenarios hint at exactly why derivatives exist and who relies on them. Derivatives—such as futures, forwards, and options—enable both individuals and organizations to manage risk or even speculate on price changes for countless underlying assets. In this section, we’re going to dive into who exactly uses these instruments, how they use them, and just how widespread these strategies have become. 

Along the way, I’ll share some behind-the-scenes looks at how different market participants approach these tools. We’ll also bring in references from Canadian regulatory contexts (particularly CIRO) and beyond, so you can see just how vital these products have become to modern finance.

### Commercial Producers/End-Users

When I think of classic derivative markets, I usually envision a farmer—let’s call him Dave—standing in a field of wheat. Dave’s always worried about the next harvest season: Are prices going to drop right when he brings his crop to market? Or maybe you’ve got an airline, like Maple Wings, that’s itching to lock in stable jet fuel costs so they can set ticket prices months in advance without getting burned by surging oil prices. These folks aren’t playing around, you know; their entire revenue or cost structure can hinge on where commodity prices are headed.

• Farmers, Energy Producers, and Other Commodity End-Users  
  – They often use futures or forward contracts to “lock in” the selling price (for producers) or the purchase price (for consumers) of commodities.  
  – By doing so, they remove—or at least reduce—the guesswork from budgeting and planning.  
  – This “hedge” lets them focus on their core business rather than fixating on short-term market swings.

Commodity end-users are truly among the earliest adopters of derivatives. The intent is straightforward: remove as much uncertainty as possible. If you flip to Chapter 4 (Hedging with Futures Contracts), you’ll see more details on how hedging is structured in real-life commercial scenarios.  

An interesting real-world example: major coffee chains typically enter into futures contracts on coffee beans. They might do this through a commodity exchange—often in the U.S. or Europe—to secure a fixed price for next year’s supply. That’s how your beloved morning latte stays the same price from month to month, even as coffee bean prices might be jumping all over the place.

### Institutional Investors

If you’ve ever thought about your retirement plan or that pension plan your employer contributes to, guess what? Many of those funds are heavily involved in derivatives. Let’s say you have a pension fund and you want to ensure that your assets are protected from sudden interest rate changes or stock market slides. Derivatives can play a central role in that.  

• Pension Funds and Insurance Companies  
  – Pension funds utilize derivatives (futures, interest rate swaps, equity index options, and more) to hedge liabilities against market shifts.  
  – Insurance companies use interest rate derivatives (such as swaps or swaptions) to reduce the impact of interest rate volatility on their long-term liabilities.

Whenever interest rates change abruptly, it can affect how much money a pension fund needs on hand to fund retiree benefits. By employing interest rate swaps (covered in Chapters 9 and 10), the funds can offset some of that risk—sort of like taking out an “insurance policy” on your insurance policy, ironically enough.

• Mutual Funds and Asset Managers  
  – Many mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) rely on derivatives for short-term risk management and to gain exposure to certain markets.  
  – For instance, an equity fund might use S&P/TSX 60 Index futures to quickly adjust their exposure to the Canadian equities market.  
  – They might also employ options strategies to enhance income (e.g., covered calls) or to protect the downside (e.g., protective puts).

Under new regulations and guidelines set by CIRO (following the MFDA and IIROC amalgamation in 2023), institutional investors must also disclose how they use derivatives in their official statements (see Chapter 14 on mutual funds and Chapter 15 on alternative mutual funds, closed-end funds, and hedge funds). The Canadian Investment Funds Standards Committee (CIFSC) has developed classification systems that help track how funds use derivatives, ensuring that investors know just how much risk is baked into their investments.

### Financial Institutions

Let’s face it: big banks and investment dealers are the lifeblood of derivatives markets. They’re the “plumbers” who keep everything flowing smoothly, as they are often the ones creating (structuring) and distributing these products in the first place.  

• Market Makers  
  – Financial institutions frequently act as “market makers,” quoting both buy and sell prices in exchange-traded derivatives like options.  
  – This ensures liquidity is available to other traders—even when the market is quiet.  
  – For instance, The Bourse de Montréal (Chapter 28) relies on approved participants (often large banks) to show continuous two-sided quotes on key options.  

• Structuring Complex Products  
  – Ever heard of an equity-linked note or a principal-protected note (PPN)? Banks structure these by combining zero-coupon bonds with a basket of options on indices or commodities.  
  – Corporate clients might need specialized interest rate or currency swap structures. A bank steps in to arrange these “over-the-counter” (OTC) derivatives tailored to a client’s risk profile.

Banks and broker-dealers aren’t just servicing others. They might also engage in proprietary trading—trading derivatives to make profits for the bank itself (not for a client). While such activities can be lucrative, they are heavily regulated due to systemic risk concerns. In Canada, CIRO keeps close tabs on capital requirements for member firms that run these complex books of derivatives. The idea is to ensure that banks remain solvent should extreme market conditions arise.

From personal experience, I once chatted with a friend who worked in a risk management group of a major Canadian bank, and they told me stories of monitoring hundreds of derivative positions daily—each with different underlying assets, maturities, and payoff structures. They were using advanced algorithms to measure the exposure of the bank’s entire portfolio to equity market swings, interest rate changes, or big movements in the U.S. dollar. Talk about mental gymnastics!

### Hedge Funds

Now, let’s take a quick trip to the world of hedge funds. Hedge funds are known for their flexibility; they don’t face the same constraints as your typical mutual fund. They can go long or short just about anything (within regulatory limits, of course) and often do so through derivatives.  

• Alpha Generation  
  – Hedge funds strive for alpha: returns above a benchmark that they attribute to their managers’ proven skill.  
  – Derivatives allow them to apply leverage (see Chapters 5 and 6 on speculation with futures and options), short-sell markets more easily, or engage in complex arbitrage.  

• Arbitrage and Proprietary Strategies  
  – Some hedge funds specialize in “arbitrage” strategies, spotting tiny price discrepancies between related derivatives and quickly profiting from them.  
  – Others might use pairs trading, long/short equity with options overlays, or interest rate swap arbitrage.

If you’re curious for real-world perspectives, “Hedge Fund Market Wizards” by Jack D. Schwager compiles interviews with some legendary hedge fund managers. They talk about how derivatives are integral to their strategies—ranging from simple covered calls to complicated multi-asset arbitrage.

### Retail Investors

Let me give you a personal anecdote here: I remember back in the day, trading an option for the first time felt nerve-racking—I was convinced I’d either lose everything or magically gain 300% overnight. Retail investors, meaning individual folks like you and me, used to be a smaller slice of the derivatives market. But not anymore.  

• Rise of Online Brokerage Platforms  
  – Retail investors now have user-friendly platforms that offer direct access to options and futures.  
  – Tools for analyzing “the Greeks” (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) are built into many trading apps.  

• Hedging and Speculation  
  – A seasoned stock investor might buy S&P/TSX 60 index puts to protect a portfolio from a market downturn.  
  – Some look to speculate using calls or puts, leveraging a small amount of capital in hopes of a significant payoff.  

• Educational Resources  
  – Many brokers or online trading classrooms teach people about straddles, spreads, or covered calls.  
  – CIRO, as the current regulator (posted-2023 amalgamation of the MFDA and IIROC), provides investor education on derivatives, cautioning individuals to recognize the higher risk involved.

Retail participation in derivatives was supercharged in recent years by two factors: (1) the surge in online trading technologies and (2) the reduced commission structures that made smaller trades more feasible. While this is great for accessibility, there’s always a risk that novices might over-leverage themselves or not fully understand the complexities. Chapters 6 and 7 of this book highlight options basics and pricing factors to help new traders become more knowledgeable before diving in.

### Extent of Derivatives Usage: Market Coverage

It’s truly staggering how big the global derivatives market is—some estimates put the notional value in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. While that number can be a bit misleading (because notional value isn’t the same as actual money at risk), it does underline the staggering scope of these instruments.  

In Canada specifically, trading volume on the Bourse de Montréal (for index options and futures, individual equity options, and interest rate futures) has steadily climbed. CIRO’s oversight ensures that each contract—whether it’s a simple stock option or a complex commodity future—follows margin requirements and comprehensive reporting guidelines.  

If you hop over to the Ontario Securities Commission’s (OSC) website at [https://www.osc.ca/](https://www.osc.ca/) and fish around in the investor warnings or data portals, you’ll see discussions on derivative usage trends. Retail flows into index options, for example, have prompted the OSC to release more educational content on the topic.  

In short, everyone’s using derivatives in some shape or form: from the local farmer worried about tomorrow’s grain prices to the giant hedge fund manager orchestrating a cunning arbitrage play. And they’re big—really big—touching nearly all corners of the financial system.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

Below is a simplified Mermaid diagram that shows how different market participants interact in a derivatives market ecosystem. It’s far from a perfect depiction, but hopefully it helps visualize the flow of trades and risk:

```

• Example 1: Airline Fuel Hedge  
  – Suppose Maple Wings anticipates using 1 million barrels of jet fuel in the next quarter. Fearing a spike in fuel prices, Maple Wings buys fuel futures (or forward contracts) at a fixed price of CAD $80 per barrel.  
  – If market prices rise above $80 during the quarter, Maple Wings benefits from the locked-in rate. Conversely, if prices fall below $80, Maple Wings ends up paying a premium compared to the prevailing spot market, but they still gain the value of stability in their budgeting.

• Example 2: Pension Fund Interest Rate Swap  
  – A Canadian pension fund invests significantly in long-term bonds to match its future liabilities. If interest rates rise sharply, bond prices fall, creating a shortfall.  
  – To offset this risk, the fund enters into a “plain vanilla” interest rate swap (discussed in Chapter 10). They pay a fixed rate to a bank while receiving a floating rate. If rates do indeed climb, the floating payment offsets some of the losses on the bond side.

• Example 3: Retail Covered Call Strategy  
  – Sarah has 500 shares of a large Canadian bank in her portfolio. She wants extra income, so she sells (writes) a call option on her bank shares. She collects a premium upfront.  
  – If the stock stays below the strike price, she keeps the premium and still holds the shares. If the stock surges above the strike price, she might have to deliver her shares at that price—but she’s earned the premium as a bit of a cushion.

These examples illustrate the variety of ways derivatives can be embedded into virtually anyone’s financial operations—be it corporate budgets, pension assets, or personal portfolios.

### Regulatory Oversight and Reporting

Given the widespread adoption of derivatives, regulators like CIRO play a key role in ensuring transparency and stability in the markets. This includes:

• Mandatory Reporting and Clearing  
  – In Canada, certain derivatives (especially standardized ones) may be required to clear through recognized clearinghouses (see Chapter 27, “The Role of Clearing Corporations…”).  
  – OTC derivatives often have trade reporting obligations to authorized trade repositories.  

• Margin Requirements and Fraud Prevention  
  – CIRO sets minimum margin requirements that reflect the inherent risk of a position.  
  – They also watch out for suspicious trading patterns and enforce best execution practices to protect market integrity.  

Retail traders, in particular, should be aware of margin calls and the possibility of being assigned on short options (if you’re writing them). For more details on how margin is handled, see Chapter 23, “Client Margin Requirements.” And if you’re looking to open a derivatives account, we’ve dedicated Chapter 22 to the entire process, so you can get a sense of what your broker might ask you for.

### Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

• **Careful with Leverage**  
  – Derivatives can amplify gains but also multiply losses. Always understand how leverage is built into these instruments.  

• **Know the Underlying**  
  – Whether it’s a commodity or a foreign exchange rate, always be up to speed on the key drivers of your underlying asset.

• **Regulatory Compliance**  
  – In Canada, always verify a derivative’s compliance with CIRO margin and reporting guidelines.  

• **Over-the-Counter vs. Exchange-Traded**  
  – OTC derivatives provide customization but can carry higher counterparty risk. Exchange-traded instruments (like many equity or index options on the Bourse de Montréal) are standardized, offering easier price discovery and clearing mechanisms.

- [ ] The total return of an investment portfolio, adjusted for fees.
- [ ] A measure of the overall market’s movements.
- [ ] The official name for interest rate swap transactions.

> **Explanation:** Alpha refers to the portion of returns a manager earns in excess of the market’s beta exposure. Hedge funds often use derivatives to achieve that excess return.

### Why have retail investors become more active in derivatives trading?

### When a pension fund uses interest rate swaps, it typically aims to:

- [ ] Speculate on short-term fluctuations in oil prices.
- [x] Hedge against the risk that interest rates will rise and reduce bond values.
- [ ] Increase exposure to volatile equity markets.
- [ ] Eliminate all market risk entirely.

> **Explanation:** Pension funds often hold long-term bonds vulnerable to rising rates. By entering swaps (pay fixed, receive floating), they reduce that interest rate risk.

### Which statement accurately describes a market maker’s function in the derivatives market?

- [ ] Reflects only the commissions charged by brokers.
- [ ] Indicates that market participants are required by law to trade large volumes.
- [ ] It is identical to the market value at risk.
- [x] Notional values can be enormous because they represent the underlying amount, not necessarily the actual capital at risk.

> **Explanation:** Notional value often references the total underlying amount covered by the contract, vastly exceeding the premium or margin posted.

### How might a retail investor use options to protect a stock portfolio?

- [x] By purchasing put options as a hedge against falling prices.
- [ ] By only selling calls without owning the underlying.
- [ ] By buying options on unrelated commodities.
- [ ] By ignoring the Greeks entirely.

> **Explanation:** A protective put strategy involves purchasing put options on an asset the investor already holds, creating a downside hedge in case the asset’s price drops.

### True or False: CIRO was formed from the amalgamation of the MFDA and IIROC on January 1, 2023.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** The MFDA and IIROC officially combined into the new Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), with full effect in 2023, overseeing investment dealers and mutual fund dealers nationally.
