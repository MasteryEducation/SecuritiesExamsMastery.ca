### Accrued Interest

### After-acquired Clause
**Definition:** A provision in a bond agreement stating that any assets acquired by the issuer after the bond is issued are included as collateral for the bond.

**Example:** A Canadian exporter might use a BA to finance the shipment of goods to a foreign buyer, with the bank guaranteeing payment.
