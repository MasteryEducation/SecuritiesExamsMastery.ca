## 6.16 Types of Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are a critical component of the fixed-income market, offering investors a range of options to diversify their portfolios and manage risk. In this section, we delve into various types of corporate bonds, focusing on their unique features and relevance within the Canadian financial landscape. Understanding these instruments is essential for making informed investment decisions and achieving financial goals.

### Mortgage Bonds

Mortgage bonds are secured by real assets, such as property or equipment, owned by the issuing corporation. This security provides an additional layer of protection for investors, as the assets can be liquidated to repay bondholders in the event of default. Mortgage bonds are particularly appealing to risk-averse investors seeking stable returns.

#### Example: Canadian Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

In Canada, mortgage bonds are often issued by real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own and manage income-producing properties. These bonds are secured by the underlying real estate assets, providing investors with a tangible assurance of repayment. For instance, a Canadian REIT might issue mortgage bonds to finance the acquisition of a commercial property, using the property itself as collateral.

### Floating-Rate Securities

Floating-rate securities, also known as variable-rate bonds, have interest payments that adjust periodically based on a benchmark rate, such as the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) or the Bank of Canada's policy rate. This feature makes them attractive in rising interest rate environments, as they offer protection against inflation and interest rate risk.

#### Example: Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs) Issued by Canadian Banks

Major Canadian banks, such as RBC and TD, often issue floating-rate notes (FRNs) to manage their interest rate exposure. These securities provide investors with the opportunity to benefit from increasing interest rates while maintaining a relatively stable principal value. For example, an FRN issued by RBC might have its interest payments linked to the CORRA, adjusting every quarter to reflect changes in the benchmark rate.

### Domestic Bonds, Foreign Bonds, and Eurobonds

Understanding the distinctions between domestic bonds, foreign bonds, and Eurobonds is crucial for investors operating in global markets.

#### Domestic Bonds

Domestic bonds are issued by Canadian corporations in the Canadian market and denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD). These bonds are subject to Canadian regulations and are typically purchased by domestic investors seeking exposure to local companies.

#### Foreign Bonds

Foreign bonds are issued in a domestic market by a foreign borrower and denominated in the domestic currency. In Canada, these are often referred to as "Maple Bonds." They allow foreign entities to access Canadian capital while providing Canadian investors with international exposure without currency risk.

#### Eurobonds

Eurobonds are international bonds issued in a currency not native to the country where they are issued. They offer issuers flexibility in choosing the currency and market for issuance, often resulting in lower borrowing costs. For Canadian corporations, issuing Eurobonds can be a strategic way to tap into global capital markets.

#### Example: Canadian Corporations in Global Markets

A Canadian mining company might issue Eurobonds denominated in U.S. dollars to attract international investors and finance its overseas operations. This strategy allows the company to benefit from the liquidity and depth of the global bond market while diversifying its investor base.

### Other Corporate Debt Instruments

In addition to the bonds discussed above, several other corporate debt instruments play a significant role in the fixed-income market.

#### Collateral Trust Bonds

Collateral trust bonds are secured by financial assets, such as stocks or bonds, held in trust by a third party. This structure provides additional security for bondholders, as the collateral can be sold to repay the debt if necessary.

#### Equipment Trust Certificates

Equipment trust certificates are secured by specific pieces of equipment, such as aircraft or machinery. These bonds are commonly used in industries with significant capital expenditures, such as transportation and manufacturing.

#### Subordinated Debentures

Subordinated debentures are unsecured bonds that rank lower in priority compared to other debts in the event of issuer default. While they offer higher yields to compensate for the increased risk, investors should carefully assess the issuer's creditworthiness before investing.

### Practical Application and Investment Strategies

Investors can leverage the diversity of corporate bonds to construct a well-balanced portfolio that aligns with their risk tolerance and investment objectives. For instance, a conservative investor might prioritize mortgage bonds and domestic bonds for their stability, while a more aggressive investor might seek higher yields through subordinated debentures and Eurobonds.
