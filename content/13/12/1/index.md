## Overview of Chapter 12

In Chapter 12 of the CSC® Exam Prep Guide: Volume 1, we delve into the intricate processes by which governments and corporations raise capital through debt or equity, the regulatory requirements involved, and the mechanisms of listing securities on exchanges. This chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the financial frameworks and strategies employed in the Canadian market, offering insights into both the opportunities and challenges faced by issuers and investors alike.

### Raising Capital: Debt and Equity

Governments and corporations raise capital primarily through two avenues: debt and equity. Each method has its unique characteristics, advantages, and implications for the issuer and investors.

#### Debt Financing

Debt financing involves borrowing funds that must be repaid over time, typically with interest. Governments often issue bonds, while corporations may issue bonds or debentures. Key considerations include:

- **Interest Rates:** The cost of borrowing, influenced by market conditions and the issuer's creditworthiness.
- **Maturity Dates:** The timeline for repayment, which can range from short-term notes to long-term bonds.
- **Covenants:** Conditions set by lenders to protect their interests, which may restrict certain corporate actions.

#### Equity Financing

Equity financing involves selling ownership stakes in the form of shares. This method does not require repayment but dilutes existing ownership. Key aspects include:

- **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs):** The process of offering shares to the public for the first time.
- **Secondary Offerings:** Additional share sales after the IPO to raise more capital.
- **Dividend Policies:** Decisions on distributing profits to shareholders, impacting investor returns.

### Prospectus Requirements and After-Market Stabilization

A prospectus is a critical document in the capital-raising process, providing potential investors with detailed information about the security offering. In Canada, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) oversee the requirements for prospectuses, ensuring transparency and investor protection.

#### Key Components of a Prospectus

- **Company Information:** Details about the issuer, including business operations, management, and financial statements.
- **Risk Factors:** Potential risks associated with the investment, helping investors make informed decisions.
- **Use of Proceeds:** How the funds raised will be utilized by the issuer.

#### After-Market Stabilization

After-market stabilization involves techniques used by underwriters to support the price of a newly issued security in the secondary market. This can include:

- **Price Support:** Buying back shares to prevent price declines.
- **Greenshoe Option:** An over-allotment option allowing underwriters to sell additional shares if demand is high, stabilizing the price.

### Methods of Distributing Securities

Securities can be distributed through various channels, each with its advantages and challenges.

#### Exchanges

Traditional exchanges like the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) provide a regulated environment for trading securities. Benefits include:

- **Liquidity:** High trading volumes facilitate buying and selling.
- **Transparency:** Regulated disclosures ensure fair trading.

#### Alternative Distribution Channels

These include over-the-counter (OTC) markets and private placements. While offering flexibility, they may involve higher risks due to less regulation and lower liquidity.

### The Listing Process

Listing securities on an exchange involves several steps, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

#### Advantages of Listing

- **Access to Capital:** Easier access to a broad investor base.
- **Increased Visibility:** Enhanced corporate profile and credibility.
- **Liquidity for Shareholders:** Easier trading of shares.

#### Disadvantages of Listing

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ongoing disclosure and reporting requirements.
- **Market Pressure:** Short-term performance pressures from investors.
- **Costs:** Significant expenses related to the listing process.

### Circumstances for Withdrawal of Trading Privileges

Trading privileges can be withdrawn under certain circumstances, such as:

- **Non-Compliance:** Failure to meet regulatory requirements.
- **Financial Distress:** Insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuer.
- **Delisting:** Voluntary or involuntary removal from an exchange, impacting liquidity and investor confidence.

### Glossary

- **After-market stabilization:** Techniques used by underwriters to support the price of a newly issued security in the secondary market.
- **Prospectus:** A formal document that provides detailed information about a security offering to potential investors.
- **Primary dealer:** Financial institutions authorized to deal directly with the government in issuing securities.
- **Public float:** The portion of outstanding shares available for trading by the public.
- **Greenshoe option:** An over-allotment option that allows underwriters to sell additional shares if demand is high.
- **Delisting:** The removal of a security from an exchange, ending its trading on that platform.
