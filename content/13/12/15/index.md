## 12.14 Capital Raising Strategies

In the dynamic world of corporate finance, raising capital is a critical function for businesses seeking growth, expansion, or even survival. This section delves into the various strategies corporations can employ to raise capital, focusing on both equity and debt instruments. We will explore the benefits of financial leverage and provide practical examples and case studies within the Canadian context.

### Understanding Capital Raising

Capital raising is the process by which companies secure funds to finance their operations, projects, or growth initiatives. This can be achieved through equity financing, debt financing, or a combination of both. Each method has its own set of advantages, disadvantages, and implications for the company's financial health and ownership structure.

### Equity Financing

Equity financing involves raising capital by selling shares of the company. This method does not require repayment and does not incur interest, but it does dilute ownership among existing shareholders. Here are some common equity instruments:

#### 1. Initial Public Offering (IPO)

An IPO is the process by which a private company offers shares to the public for the first time. This can significantly increase a company's capital base and visibility. In Canada, companies must comply with regulations set by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC).

**Case Study: Shopify's IPO**

Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce company, went public in 2015, raising $131 million CAD. This capital infusion allowed Shopify to expand its platform and services, contributing to its growth into a global e-commerce leader.

#### 2. Secondary Offerings

Once a company is public, it can issue additional shares through secondary offerings. This can be a cost-effective way to raise capital without the complexities of an IPO.

#### 3. Private Placements

Private placements involve selling securities to a select group of investors, such as institutional investors or accredited individuals. This method is less regulated and can be quicker than public offerings.

#### 4. Capital Pool Companies (CPCs)

A unique Canadian mechanism, CPCs allow companies to raise funds through an IPO with the intention of acquiring an existing business or assets. This strategy provides a streamlined path to becoming a publicly traded company.

### Debt Financing

Debt financing involves borrowing funds that must be repaid over time, typically with interest. This method does not dilute ownership but does require regular interest payments. Common debt instruments include:

#### 1. Corporate Bonds

Companies can issue bonds to raise capital, promising to pay back the principal along with interest at specified intervals. Bonds can be attractive to investors seeking stable returns.

#### 2. Bank Loans

Traditional bank loans are a common form of debt financing. They can be tailored to meet specific needs, such as working capital or capital expenditures.

#### 3. Convertible Debentures

These are hybrid instruments that combine features of debt and equity. They can be converted into equity at a later date, providing flexibility to both the issuer and the investor.

### Financial Leverage

Financial leverage involves using borrowed funds to increase the potential return on investment. By leveraging debt, companies can amplify their returns, but this also increases financial risk. The key is to balance the benefits of leverage with the potential risks.

**Example: Financial Leverage in Action**

Consider a Canadian manufacturing company that uses a bank loan to purchase new machinery. The increased production capacity leads to higher sales and profits, which exceed the cost of the loan. This is a successful application of financial leverage.

### Best Practices and Challenges

#### Best Practices

- **Diversification:** Use a mix of equity and debt to optimize capital structure.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhere to Canadian securities regulations to avoid legal issues.
- **Risk Management:** Carefully assess the risks associated with financial leverage.

#### Common Challenges

- **Market Volatility:** Fluctuations in the market can impact the success of capital raising efforts.
- **Interest Rate Risk:** Rising interest rates can increase the cost of debt financing.
- **Dilution Concerns:** Equity financing can dilute existing shareholders' ownership.

### Practical Application and Strategy

To effectively raise capital, companies should:

1. **Assess Financial Needs:** Determine the amount of capital required and the best method to raise it.
2. **Evaluate Market Conditions:** Consider the current economic environment and investor sentiment.
3. **Engage Financial Advisors:** Work with experts to navigate complex financial instruments and regulations.
4. **Communicate with Stakeholders:** Keep investors and stakeholders informed about capital raising plans and their implications.
