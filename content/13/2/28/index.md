Understanding the capital market is crucial for anyone involved in finance, particularly within the Canadian context. This glossary provides detailed definitions and explanations of key terms related to the capital market, helping you navigate the complexities of financial transactions, investment strategies, and regulatory frameworks. Each term is accompanied by practical examples and insights to enhance your comprehension and application of these concepts.

### Alternative Trading System (ATS)
An **Alternative Trading System (ATS)** is an electronic marketplace that matches buyers and sellers of securities outside of traditional exchanges. These systems provide a platform for trading securities that may not be listed on formal exchanges like the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). ATSs offer increased flexibility and often lower transaction costs. For example, a Canadian investor might use an ATS to trade shares of a small-cap company that isn't listed on the TSX, benefiting from potentially lower fees and faster execution times.

### Ask Price
The **Ask Price** is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a security. It represents the minimum amount a seller expects to receive in exchange for a security. For instance, if the ask price for a share of a Canadian bank is $100, it means the seller is willing to sell the share for no less than $100.

### Auction Market
An **Auction Market** is a market where buyers and sellers enter competitive bids simultaneously. The TSX operates as an auction market, where securities are traded through a continuous auction process. This system ensures transparency and fair pricing, as the highest bid and lowest ask determine the transaction price.

### Bid Price
The **Bid Price** is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security. It reflects the demand for a security in the market. For example, if the bid price for a government bond is $95, it indicates that a buyer is willing to purchase the bond for up to $95.

### Bid-Ask Spread
The **Bid-Ask Spread** is the difference between the bid price and the ask price. It represents the transaction cost and liquidity of a security. A narrow spread indicates high liquidity, while a wide spread suggests lower liquidity. For instance, a blue-chip stock on the TSX might have a bid-ask spread of $0.01, reflecting its high liquidity.

**Capital** refers to wealth in the form of money or assets owned by a person or organization. It is used to fund business operations, investments, and growth. In the Canadian context, capital can include cash, real estate, and investments in stocks and bonds.

### Capital Channeling

### Capital Market
