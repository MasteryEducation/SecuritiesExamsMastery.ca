## 11.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Incorporation

Incorporation is a significant decision for any business, offering a range of advantages and disadvantages that must be carefully considered. This section explores these aspects in detail, focusing on the Canadian context, to help you understand the implications of incorporating a business.

### Advantages of Incorporation

#### 1. Limited Liability

One of the most compelling reasons to incorporate is the protection of personal assets through limited liability. In a corporation, shareholders are not personally liable for the company's debts beyond their investment in shares. This means that personal assets such as homes and savings are protected if the corporation faces financial difficulties.

**Example:** Consider a Canadian tech startup that faces a lawsuit due to a product malfunction. If the company is incorporated, the personal assets of its founders are shielded from any legal claims, limiting financial exposure to the assets held by the corporation itself.

#### 2. Continuity of Existence

Corporations enjoy perpetual existence, meaning they continue to exist even if ownership or management changes. This stability can be crucial for long-term business planning and can enhance the company's reputation and relationships with stakeholders.

**Example:** A family-owned business in Canada can incorporate to ensure that the business continues seamlessly through generations, regardless of changes in family involvement.

#### 3. Ease of Ownership Transfer

Shares of a corporation can be easily transferred, allowing for straightforward changes in ownership. This flexibility can facilitate investment, mergers, and acquisitions, making it easier to attract investors or sell the business.

**Example:** A Canadian manufacturing company can attract new investors by issuing shares, thereby raising capital without disrupting operations or management.

#### 4. Ability to Raise Capital

Corporations can raise capital more easily than other business structures by issuing shares or bonds. This ability to access capital markets can support growth and expansion efforts.

**Example:** A Canadian corporation can issue additional shares to fund the development of a new product line, leveraging the capital markets to fuel growth.

#### 5. Growth Potential

Incorporation can enhance a company's growth potential by providing access to larger pools of capital and professional management. This can lead to increased market share and competitiveness.

**Example:** A Canadian retail chain can expand nationally by incorporating and attracting investment from institutional investors, enabling it to open new locations across the country.

#### 6. Professional Management

Incorporated businesses can attract experienced managers and executives by offering competitive compensation packages, including stock options. This professional management can drive strategic growth and operational efficiency.

**Example:** A Canadian biotech firm can recruit top talent from the industry by offering stock options, aligning management's interests with those of shareholders.

### Disadvantages of Incorporation

#### 1. Inflexibility

Incorporation can introduce inflexibility due to regulatory requirements and the need to adhere to corporate bylaws. Making changes to the corporate structure can be time-consuming and costly.

**Example:** A Canadian corporation may face challenges when attempting to pivot its business model due to the need for shareholder approval and regulatory compliance.

#### 2. Double Taxation

Corporations face double taxation, where profits are taxed at the corporate level, and dividends are taxed again at the shareholder level. This can reduce the overall return on investment for shareholders.

**Example:** A Canadian corporation earns a profit, which is taxed at the corporate rate. When dividends are distributed to shareholders, they are taxed again at the individual level, diminishing the net income received by shareholders.

#### 3. Higher Expenses

Incorporating a business involves higher costs, including legal fees, registration fees, and ongoing compliance costs. These expenses can be burdensome for small businesses or startups.

**Example:** A small Canadian startup may find the costs of incorporation prohibitive, opting instead for a simpler business structure like a sole proprietorship or partnership.

#### 4. Complex Capital Withdrawal Processes

Withdrawing capital from a corporation can be complex due to regulatory requirements and tax implications. This can limit the flexibility of business owners in accessing funds.

**Example:** A Canadian entrepreneur may face challenges in withdrawing profits from their corporation without incurring significant tax liabilities, requiring careful planning and consultation with tax professionals.

### Real-World Examples

**Case Study: RBC's Incorporation Benefits**

The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) leverages its corporate structure to access capital markets, raise funds through equity and debt offerings, and maintain a robust governance framework. This has enabled RBC to expand its operations globally and invest in innovative financial products.

**Case Study: Small Business Challenges**

A small Canadian bakery incorporated to protect personal assets but faced challenges with double taxation and compliance costs. The owners had to carefully manage cash flow and seek professional advice to navigate these complexities.

### Glossary

- **Limited Liability:** Protection for shareholders where their personal assets are not liable for the company’s debts.
- **Double Taxation:** The phenomenon where corporate profits are taxed, and then shareholders are taxed again on dividends.
- **Inflexibility:** The difficulty in making changes to corporate structure and bylaws due to regulatory requirements.
