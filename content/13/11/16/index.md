## Glossary for Chapter 11: Key Financial Terms for Corporations

Understanding the financial statements of corporations is crucial for anyone involved in the financial services industry. This glossary provides detailed explanations of key terms related to corporate finance and financial statements, offering insights into their practical applications within the Canadian market. Each term is accompanied by examples and explanations to help you grasp these concepts and apply them effectively in your professional practice.

### Amortization

**Definition:** Amortization refers to the gradual reduction of a debt over a period through regular payments. It is commonly used in the context of loans and intangible assets.

**Example:** Consider a Canadian company that has taken a $100,000 loan with an interest rate of 5% to be paid over 10 years. The company will make regular monthly payments that cover both the principal and interest, gradually reducing the outstanding balance. This process is known as amortization.

**Practical Insight:** Amortization schedules help businesses manage cash flow by spreading out payments over time. Understanding amortization is essential for evaluating the cost of financing and the impact on financial statements.

### Book Value

**Definition:** Book value is the net asset value of a company, calculated as total assets minus total liabilities. It represents the value of a company's equity as recorded on the balance sheet.

**Example:** If a Canadian company has total assets of $500,000 and total liabilities of $300,000, its book value would be $200,000.

**Practical Insight:** Investors often compare a company's book value to its market value to assess whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. A higher market value compared to book value may indicate strong investor confidence.

### Capitalization

**Definition:** Capitalization involves recording a cost as an asset rather than an expense, allowing the cost to be spread over multiple periods.

**Example:** A Canadian technology firm purchases a piece of equipment for $50,000. Instead of expensing the entire amount in the year of purchase, the company capitalizes the cost and depreciates it over its useful life, say 10 years.

**Practical Insight:** Capitalization affects a company's financial statements by impacting both the balance sheet and income statement. It is crucial for accurately reflecting the long-term value of assets.

### Depreciation

**Definition:** Depreciation is the allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It reflects the wear and tear or obsolescence of an asset.

**Example:** A Canadian manufacturing company buys machinery for $100,000 with an expected useful life of 10 years. Using straight-line depreciation, the company would expense $10,000 annually.

**Practical Insight:** Depreciation affects net income and tax liabilities. Different methods (e.g., straight-line, declining balance) can be used, impacting financial analysis and decision-making.

### Equity

**Definition:** Equity represents the residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting liabilities. It is synonymous with shareholders' equity or net worth.

**Example:** A Canadian retail company has assets worth $1 million and liabilities of $600,000. The equity, or shareholders' equity, would be $400,000.

**Practical Insight:** Equity is a key indicator of a company's financial health. It provides a buffer against losses and is a critical component in calculating financial ratios like return on equity (ROE).

### Goodwill

**Definition:** Goodwill is an intangible asset representing the excess value paid during an acquisition over the fair market value of identifiable net assets.

**Example:** If a Canadian company acquires another company for $1.5 million, and the fair value of the acquired company's net assets is $1 million, the goodwill recorded would be $500,000.

**Practical Insight:** Goodwill reflects the value of a company's brand, customer relationships, and other intangible factors. It is subject to impairment testing, which can impact financial statements.

### Insider Trading

**Definition:** Insider trading is the illegal practice of trading on the stock exchange to one's own advantage through having access to confidential information.

**Example:** A Canadian executive learns of an upcoming merger and buys shares in the company before the information is public, profiting from the subsequent price increase.

**Practical Insight:** Insider trading is heavily regulated in Canada, with severe penalties for violations. Understanding these regulations is crucial for compliance and maintaining market integrity.

### Liquidity

**Definition:** Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price.

**Example:** Cash and government bonds are considered highly liquid assets, while real estate is less liquid due to the time and effort required to sell.

**Practical Insight:** Liquidity is vital for meeting short-term obligations and managing financial risk. Companies and investors must balance liquidity with returns to optimize financial performance.

### Non-Controlling Interest

**Definition:** Non-controlling interest is the portion of equity ownership in a subsidiary not attributable to the parent company.

**Example:** A Canadian conglomerate owns 80% of a subsidiary, with the remaining 20% held by other investors. The non-controlling interest represents this 20% ownership.

**Practical Insight:** Non-controlling interests affect consolidated financial statements and reflect the portion of profits or losses attributable to minority shareholders.

### Proxy

**Definition:** A proxy is the authority to represent someone else, especially in the voting at a shareholders' meeting.

**Example:** A Canadian shareholder unable to attend a company's annual general meeting may appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf.

**Practical Insight:** Proxies enable shareholders to participate in corporate governance without being physically present. Understanding proxy rules is essential for effective shareholder engagement.

### Retained Earnings

**Definition:** Retained earnings are the cumulative amount of net income retained by a company rather than distributed to its shareholders as dividends.

**Example:** A Canadian company earns $100,000 in net income and decides to retain $60,000 for future growth, adding this amount to retained earnings.

**Practical Insight:** Retained earnings provide a source of internal financing for expansion and investment. They reflect a company's profitability and growth potential over time.

### Sinking Fund

**Definition:** A sinking fund is a means by which an organization sets aside money over time to retire its indebtedness.

**Example:** A Canadian corporation issues bonds with a sinking fund provision, requiring it to set aside funds annually to repay the principal at maturity.

**Practical Insight:** Sinking funds reduce default risk and enhance creditworthiness. They provide a structured approach to managing long-term debt obligations.

### Statement of Changes in Equity

**Definition:** A statement of changes in equity is a financial statement that shows the movement in equity from the end of one fiscal period to the end of the next.

**Example:** A Canadian company's statement of changes in equity details changes in share capital, retained earnings, and other equity components over the fiscal year.

**Practical Insight:** This statement provides insights into a company's financial strategy, including dividend policies and capital structure changes. It is essential for comprehensive financial analysis.

### Subordinated Debenture

**Definition:** A subordinated debenture is a type of debt that ranks below other loans and securities with respect to claims on assets or earnings.

**Example:** A Canadian bank issues subordinated debentures, which will be repaid only after senior debt obligations are met in the event of liquidation.

**Practical Insight:** Subordinated debentures offer higher yields due to increased risk. They are a key component of a diversified fixed-income portfolio.

### Takeover Bid

**Definition:** A takeover bid is an offer to purchase a controlling interest in a company’s shares in order to take control of that company.

**Example:** A Canadian mining company launches a takeover bid for a smaller competitor, offering a premium over the current market price to acquire a majority stake.

**Practical Insight:** Takeover bids can significantly impact share prices and corporate strategy. Understanding the regulatory framework is crucial for navigating mergers and acquisitions.

### Yield to Maturity

**Definition:** Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until it matures.

**Example:** A Canadian investor purchases a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a market price of $950. The YTM calculation considers the coupon payments and the gain from purchasing the bond at a discount.

**Practical Insight:** YTM is a critical measure for bond investors, providing a comprehensive view of potential returns. It helps compare bonds with different maturities and coupon rates.
