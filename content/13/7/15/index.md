## 7.15 The Impact of Maturity

In the realm of fixed-income securities, the concept of maturity plays a pivotal role in determining the price volatility of bonds. Understanding how the term to maturity affects bond prices is crucial for investors, particularly in the context of interest rate changes. This section delves into the intricacies of bond maturity, comparing the price sensitivity of short-term versus long-term bonds, and elucidating why longer-term bonds exhibit greater price volatility.

### Understanding Maturity

**Maturity** refers to the date on which a bond's principal is repaid to the bondholder. It is a fundamental characteristic of bonds that influences their behavior in the market. The term to maturity can range from a few months to several decades, with each duration exhibiting distinct price sensitivities to interest rate fluctuations.

### The Relationship Between Maturity and Price Volatility

The term to maturity is a critical factor in determining a bond's price volatility. Generally, bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to interest rate changes than those with shorter maturities. This sensitivity is due to the present value of a bond's cash flows being more affected by changes in interest rates when those cash flows are further in the future.

#### Price Sensitivity: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Bonds

- **Short-Term Bonds:** These bonds typically have maturities of less than five years. They are less sensitive to interest rate changes because their cash flows are realized sooner. As a result, the present value of these cash flows is less impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.

- **Long-Term Bonds:** Bonds with maturities extending beyond ten years are considered long-term. These bonds exhibit greater price volatility because their cash flows occur further in the future. Consequently, the present value of these cash flows is more susceptible to changes in interest rates.

### Why Longer-Term Bonds Exhibit Greater Price Volatility

The greater price volatility of longer-term bonds can be attributed to the concept of **duration**, which measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes. Duration is influenced by the time remaining until a bond's maturity and the size and timing of its cash flows. Longer-term bonds have higher durations, meaning their prices are more volatile in response to interest rate movements.

#### Example: Impact of Maturity on Bond Prices

Consider two bonds issued by the Government of Canada:

1. **Bond A:** A short-term bond with a maturity of 3 years and a coupon rate of 3%.
2. **Bond B:** A long-term bond with a maturity of 20 years and a coupon rate of 3%.

Suppose the market interest rate increases by 1%. The price of Bond A will decrease slightly due to its short duration, while the price of Bond B will experience a more significant decline because of its longer duration. This example illustrates how the term to maturity affects bond price volatility.

### Practical Implications for Investors

Investors must consider the term to maturity when constructing their bond portfolios. Short-term bonds may be preferable for those seeking stability and lower interest rate risk, while long-term bonds might appeal to investors willing to accept higher volatility for potentially greater returns.

#### Canadian Context: Regulatory Considerations

In Canada, the regulatory framework governing fixed-income securities is overseen by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and provincial regulators. Investors should be aware of these regulations when engaging in bond trading and portfolio management.

Understanding the impact of maturity on bond price volatility is essential for making informed investment decisions. By recognizing the differences in price sensitivity between short-term and long-term bonds, investors can better manage their portfolios in response to interest rate changes. As the Canadian financial landscape continues to evolve, staying informed about regulatory developments and market trends will be crucial for successful bond investing.
