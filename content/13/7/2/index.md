## 7.2 Calculating Price and Yield of a Bond

Understanding how to calculate the price and yield of a bond is crucial for anyone involved in fixed-income securities. This section will guide you through the process of determining a bond's fair price by calculating the present value of its future cash flows. We will also explore the differences between simple and semi-annual coupon bonds, providing formulas and step-by-step examples to solidify your understanding.

### Understanding Present Value and Future Value

Before diving into bond pricing, it's essential to grasp the concepts of Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV):

- **Present Value (PV):** The current value of a future amount of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. It answers the question, "What is the value today of a cash flow that will be received in the future?"
- **Future Value (FV):** The value of an investment after it has earned interest for a certain period. It answers the question, "What will this investment be worth in the future?"

### Calculating the Present Value of a Bond's Future Cash Flows

A bond's price is essentially the present value of its future cash flows, which include periodic coupon payments and the repayment of the principal at maturity. The formula for calculating the present value of a bond is:

{{< katex >}} 
PV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{M}{(1 + r)^n} 
{{< /katex >}}

Where:
- \\( PV \\) = Present Value or price of the bond
- \\( C \\) = Coupon payment
- \\( r \\) = Discount rate or yield to maturity
- \\( t \\) = Time period
- \\( n \\) = Total number of periods
- \\( M \\) = Maturity value or face value of the bond

### Example: Calculating the Price of a Bond

Let's consider a Canadian bond with the following characteristics:
- Face value (\\( M \\)) = CAD 1,000
- Annual coupon rate = 5%
- Maturity = 3 years
- Yield to maturity (\\( r \\)) = 4%

#### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate the annual coupon payment (\\( C \\)):**

   {{< katex >}}
   C = \text{Face value} \times \text{Coupon rate} = 1,000 \times 0.05 = CAD 50
   {{< /katex >}}

2. **Calculate the present value of the coupon payments:**

   {{< katex >}}
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = \frac{50}{(1 + 0.04)^1} + \frac{50}{(1 + 0.04)^2} + \frac{50}{(1 + 0.04)^3}
   {{< /katex >}}

   {{< katex >}}
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = 48.08 + 46.23 + 44.45 = CAD 138.76
   {{< /katex >}}

3. **Calculate the present value of the face value:**

   {{< katex >}}
   PV_{\text{face value}} = \frac{1,000}{(1 + 0.04)^3} = 889.00
   {{< /katex >}}

4. **Calculate the total present value (price of the bond):**

   {{< katex >}}
   PV = PV_{\text{coupons}} + PV_{\text{face value}} = 138.76 + 889.00 = CAD 1,027.76
   {{< /katex >}}

### Simple vs. Semi-Annual Coupon Bonds

In Canada, many bonds pay interest semi-annually. This affects the calculation of the bond's price and yield. For semi-annual coupon bonds, the formula is adjusted to account for the more frequent compounding periods.

#### Adjusted Formula for Semi-Annual Coupon Bonds

For semi-annual bonds, the coupon payment is halved, and the number of periods is doubled. The discount rate is also halved:

{{< katex >}} 
PV = \sum_{t=1}^{2n} \frac{C/2}{(1 + r/2)^t} + \frac{M}{(1 + r/2)^{2n}} 
{{< /katex >}}

### Example: Semi-Annual Coupon Bond

Consider the same bond as before, but with semi-annual coupon payments:

1. **Calculate the semi-annual coupon payment:**

   {{< katex >}}
   C/2 = 50/2 = CAD 25
   {{< /katex >}}

2. **Calculate the present value of the coupon payments:**

   {{< katex >}}
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = \frac{25}{(1 + 0.02)^1} + \frac{25}{(1 + 0.02)^2} + \ldots + \frac{25}{(1 + 0.02)^6}
   {{< /katex >}}

   {{< katex >}}
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = 24.51 + 24.03 + 23.55 + 23.08 + 22.61 + 22.15 = CAD 139.93
   {{< /katex >}}

3. **Calculate the present value of the face value:**

   {{< katex >}}
   PV_{\text{face value}} = \frac{1,000}{(1 + 0.02)^6} = 888.49
   {{< /katex >}}

4. **Calculate the total present value (price of the bond):**

   {{< katex >}}
   PV = PV_{\text{coupons}} + PV_{\text{face value}} = 139.93 + 888.49 = CAD 1,028.42
   {{< /katex >}}

### Practical Tools and Resources

For those looking to automate these calculations, the [Bank of Canada Bond Calculator](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/canvas/bond-calculator/) is an excellent resource. Additionally, *The Bond Book* by Annette Thau provides further insights into bond investing.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices:**
  - Always verify the bond's coupon frequency and adjust calculations accordingly.
  - Use reliable financial calculators or software to minimize errors in complex calculations.

- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Failing to adjust for semi-annual coupon payments can lead to significant pricing errors.
  - Ignoring changes in market interest rates can affect the accuracy of yield calculations.

### Conclusion

Calculating the price and yield of a bond is a fundamental skill for finance professionals. By understanding the present value of future cash flows and adjusting for coupon frequency, you can accurately assess a bond's fair price. This knowledge is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the Canadian financial market.
