## 7.20 Glossary for Chapter 7

In this section, we delve into the essential terms and concepts related to fixed-income securities, focusing on their pricing and trading. Understanding these terms is crucial for anyone involved in the financial markets, particularly in the Canadian context. This glossary will serve as a valuable resource for grasping the intricacies of fixed-income investments.

### Bond Yield
**Definition:** The return an investor expects to earn from a bond.  
**Explanation:** Bond yield is a critical measure for investors, indicating the income generated from a bond investment relative to its price. It encompasses various yield measures, including current yield and yield to maturity (YTM), each providing different insights into the bond's performance.

### Interest Rate
**Definition:** The cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage.  
**Explanation:** Interest rates are pivotal in the fixed-income market, influencing bond prices and yields. They are determined by central banks, such as the Bank of Canada, and affect the broader economy by impacting borrowing costs and investment returns.

### Secondary Market
**Definition:** A market where investors buy and sell securities they already own.  
**Explanation:** The secondary market is vital for liquidity, allowing investors to trade bonds after their initial issuance. It includes exchanges like the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and over-the-counter (OTC) markets.

### Present Value (PV)
**Definition:** The current value of a future amount of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.  
**Explanation:** Present value is a fundamental concept in bond pricing, used to determine the fair price of a bond by discounting future cash flows to their present value using a discount rate.

### Future Value (FV)
**Definition:** The value of an investment after it has earned interest for a certain period.  
**Explanation:** Future value calculations help investors understand the growth potential of their investments over time, considering compound interest.

### Discount Rate
**Definition:** The interest rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.  
**Explanation:** The discount rate reflects the opportunity cost of capital and is crucial in determining the present value of a bond's cash flows, influencing its fair price.

### Fair Price
**Definition:** The theoretical price of a bond calculated based on the present value of its cash flows.  
**Explanation:** Fair price is an essential concept for investors seeking to assess whether a bond is overvalued or undervalued in the market.

### Current Yield
**Definition:** The bond’s annual coupon payment divided by its current market price.  
**Explanation:** Current yield provides a snapshot of a bond's income relative to its price, useful for comparing bonds with different prices and coupon rates.

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)
**Definition:** The total return expected from a bond if held until maturity, considering both coupon payments and any capital gain or loss.  
**Explanation:** YTM is a comprehensive measure of a bond's return, accounting for all cash flows and the time value of money, making it a key metric for bond investors.

### Reinvestment Risk
**Definition:** The risk that future coupon payments will have to be reinvested at lower interest rates than the original bond.  
**Explanation:** Reinvestment risk is a concern for investors in a declining interest rate environment, as it can reduce the overall return on a bond investment.

### Term Structure of Interest Rates
**Definition:** The relationship between bond yields and their maturities.  
**Explanation:** The term structure is depicted by the yield curve, which provides insights into market expectations for future interest rates and economic conditions.

### Yield Curve
**Definition:** A graph that plots the yields of bonds with different maturities.  
**Explanation:** The yield curve is a powerful tool for analyzing interest rate trends and economic outlooks. It can take various shapes, such as normal, inverted, or flat, each indicating different market conditions.

### Expectations Theory
**Definition:** A theory that suggests long-term interest rates are an average of current and expected future short-term rates.  
**Explanation:** Expectations theory helps explain the shape of the yield curve, suggesting that investors' expectations about future interest rates influence long-term yields.

### Liquidity Preference Theory
**Definition:** A theory that suggests investors demand a premium for holding longer-term bonds due to increased risk and lower liquidity.  
**Explanation:** This theory posits that the yield curve reflects a liquidity premium, with longer-term bonds offering higher yields to compensate for their risks.

### Market Segmentation Theory
**Definition:** A theory that posits the yield curve is determined by supply and demand within separate maturity segments.  
**Explanation:** Market segmentation theory suggests that different investor preferences and institutional constraints create distinct demand and supply dynamics across maturity segments.

### Price-Yield Relationship
**Definition:** The inverse relationship between bond prices and their yields.  
**Explanation:** As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is fundamental to understanding bond market dynamics.

### Interest Rate Risk
**Definition:** The risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of a bond.  
**Explanation:** Interest rate risk is a primary concern for bond investors, as fluctuations in rates can lead to capital losses or gains.

### Duration
**Definition:** A weighted average time until a bond’s cash flows are received, used as a measure of interest rate sensitivity.  
**Explanation:** Duration is a critical metric for assessing a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes, helping investors manage interest rate risk.
