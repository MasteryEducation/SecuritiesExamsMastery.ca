## 9.17 Good Through Orders

In the dynamic world of securities trading, understanding the various order types available to investors is crucial for optimizing trading strategies and achieving investment goals. One such order type is the "Good Through Order," which offers flexibility and strategic advantages for traders looking to maintain their positions over a specified period. This section delves into the mechanics, benefits, and practical applications of Good Through Orders within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Definition and Mechanics of Good Through Orders

A Good Through Order, often referred to as a "Good Till Date" order, is a type of limit order that remains active until a specified date. Unlike a day order, which expires at the end of the trading day if not executed, a Good Through Order persists across multiple trading days, providing investors with the opportunity to execute trades at their desired price point over an extended period.

#### How Good Through Orders Work

When placing a Good Through Order, the investor specifies a price at which they are willing to buy or sell a security, along with a "good through date" that indicates the order's expiration. If the market reaches the specified price before the expiration date, the order is executed. If not, the order is automatically canceled on the expiration date.

**Example:**

Consider an investor who wants to purchase shares of a Canadian company, such as Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), at a specific price. The current market price is $100 per share, but the investor believes the price might drop to $95 within the next two weeks. By placing a Good Through Order with a limit price of $95 and a good through date set for two weeks later, the investor can automatically purchase the shares if the price reaches $95 within the specified period.

### Validity Over Multiple Days Until the Specified Date

The primary advantage of Good Through Orders is their validity over multiple trading days. This feature allows investors to maintain their trading strategy without the need to monitor the market constantly or re-enter orders daily. It is particularly beneficial in volatile markets where prices can fluctuate significantly over short periods.

#### Strategic Advantages

1. **Reduced Monitoring:** Investors can set their desired price and expiration date, reducing the need for constant market monitoring.
   
2. **Flexibility:** Good Through Orders provide the flexibility to adjust the order's parameters, such as the limit price or expiration date, as market conditions change.

3. **Strategic Planning:** Investors can align their trading strategies with broader market trends, taking advantage of potential price movements over time.

4. **Cost Efficiency:** By avoiding frequent order placements, investors can minimize transaction costs associated with multiple trades.

### Strategic Advantages of Using Good Through Orders for Sustained Trading

Good Through Orders are particularly useful for investors who have a long-term view of the market and wish to capitalize on anticipated price movements without immediate execution pressure. Here are some strategic scenarios where Good Through Orders can be advantageous:

1. **Market Volatility:** In volatile markets, prices can swing widely. A Good Through Order allows investors to set a target price and wait for the market to reach it, rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations.

2. **Long-Term Investment Goals:** Investors with long-term objectives can use Good Through Orders to accumulate shares at favorable prices over time, aligning with their investment strategy.

3. **Risk Management:** By setting a limit price, investors can manage their risk exposure, ensuring they do not overpay for a security or sell below a desired price.

4. **Automated Trading Strategy:** Good Through Orders enable a more automated approach to trading, allowing investors to focus on other aspects of their portfolio or investment strategy.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Fund Strategy

Consider a Canadian pension fund that aims to increase its holdings in a stable, dividend-paying stock like Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). The fund managers anticipate a market correction and decide to place a Good Through Order to buy shares at a 5% discount from the current market price, with a good through date set for the next month. This strategy allows the fund to potentially acquire shares at a lower cost, enhancing the overall return on investment.
