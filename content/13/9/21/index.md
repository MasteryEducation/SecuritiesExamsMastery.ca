## 9.20 Professional (PRO) Orders

In the realm of equity transactions, understanding the nuances of Professional (PRO) Orders is crucial for anyone involved in the Canadian financial markets. These orders, which are typically placed by individuals or entities with a professional interest in the market, such as brokers or dealers, have specific rules and implications that affect their execution priority. This section delves into the definition, priority rules, and practical handling of PRO orders, providing a comprehensive guide for financial professionals.

### Definition and Priority Rules for PRO Orders

**PRO Order**: A Professional (PRO) Order is an order placed by a dealer member or an individual acting in a professional capacity, such as a broker or a trader. These orders are distinct from client orders and are subject to specific priority rules.

In the Canadian financial markets, PRO orders are given a lower priority compared to client orders. This means that when orders are being executed, client orders are filled first, ensuring that the interests of clients are prioritized over those of the professionals executing the trades. This rule is designed to maintain fairness and integrity in the market, preventing potential conflicts of interest where professionals might otherwise prioritize their own trades over those of their clients.

### Importance of Labeling Orders as PRO, Non-Client, or Employee

Proper labeling of orders is essential for compliance and transparency in trading activities. Orders must be clearly identified as PRO, non-client, or employee orders to ensure they are executed in accordance with regulatory requirements and priority rules.

- **Non-Client Order**: This refers to orders placed by the dealer member for their own account, not on behalf of a client. These orders are treated similarly to PRO orders in terms of execution priority.
  
- **Employee Order**: Orders placed by employees of a dealer member for their personal accounts. These must also be labeled appropriately to ensure they are executed after client orders.

Accurate labeling helps in maintaining the integrity of the trading process, ensuring that all market participants are treated fairly and that the priority rules are adhered to.

### Impact on Order Execution Priority Within Dealer Members

The execution priority of orders within dealer members is significantly influenced by whether an order is labeled as a PRO, non-client, or employee order. The general hierarchy for order execution is as follows:

1. **Client Orders**: These are executed first, reflecting the priority given to client interests.
2. **PRO Orders**: Executed after all client orders have been filled.
3. **Non-Client and Employee Orders**: These are typically executed after client and PRO orders.

This hierarchy ensures that dealer members act in the best interest of their clients, maintaining trust and compliance with regulatory standards.

### Examples Illustrating How PRO Orders Are Handled in Trading Scenarios

To better understand how PRO orders are handled, consider the following scenarios:

**Example 1:**

A dealer member receives three orders at the same time:
- A client order to buy 100 shares of Company A.
- A PRO order to buy 100 shares of Company A.
- An employee order to buy 100 shares of Company A.

In this scenario, the client order will be executed first. Once the client order is filled, the PRO order will be executed, followed by the employee order.

**Example 2:**

A dealer member has a standing PRO order to sell 200 shares of Company B. A client places an order to buy 200 shares of Company B. Even though the PRO order was placed first, the client order will take precedence and be executed first.

These examples highlight the importance of understanding order types and their execution priorities, ensuring that professionals in the market act in accordance with established rules and regulations.
