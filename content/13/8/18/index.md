## 8.18 Foreign-Pay Preferred Shares

Foreign-pay preferred shares are a unique class of preferred shares that offer dividends paid in a foreign currency or are tied to foreign currency metrics. These financial instruments can provide Canadian investors with opportunities for enhanced returns and diversification, but they also introduce specific risks, particularly related to currency fluctuations. In this section, we will delve into the characteristics, advantages, and risks of foreign-pay preferred shares, and explore how they can be effectively utilized in a diversified investment portfolio.

### Understanding Foreign-Pay Preferred Shares

Foreign-pay preferred shares are similar to traditional preferred shares in that they represent a class of ownership in a corporation with a fixed dividend. However, the key distinction lies in the currency in which dividends are paid. For foreign-pay preferreds, dividends are either paid in a foreign currency or are linked to foreign currency exchange rates. This feature can be attractive to investors seeking exposure to foreign markets or currencies.

#### Advantages of Foreign-Pay Preferred Shares

1. **Currency Diversification**: By receiving dividends in a foreign currency, investors can gain exposure to currency movements, which can be beneficial if the foreign currency appreciates against the Canadian dollar.

2. **Potential for Higher Yields**: Foreign-pay preferred shares may offer higher yields compared to domestic preferred shares, especially in markets where interest rates are higher than in Canada.

3. **Access to Global Markets**: These shares provide Canadian investors with access to international markets, potentially offering opportunities for growth that are not available domestically.

4. **Inflation Hedge**: In some cases, foreign currencies may provide a hedge against inflation, particularly if the foreign economy is experiencing lower inflation rates than Canada.

### Currency Risk in Foreign-Pay Preferred Shares

While foreign-pay preferred shares offer several advantages, they also introduce currency risk, which is the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates. This risk can impact the value of dividends received and the overall return on investment. 

#### Managing Currency Risk

1. **Hedging Strategies**: Investors can use hedging strategies, such as currency futures or options, to mitigate currency risk. These financial instruments allow investors to lock in exchange rates, reducing the impact of currency fluctuations.

2. **Diversification**: By diversifying investments across multiple currencies, investors can reduce the impact of adverse currency movements in any single currency.

3. **Monitoring Economic Indicators**: Keeping an eye on economic indicators and geopolitical events can help investors anticipate currency movements and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

### Foreign-Pay Preferred Shares for Portfolio Diversification

Incorporating foreign-pay preferred shares into a portfolio can enhance diversification, providing exposure to different economic environments and currency dynamics. This diversification can help reduce overall portfolio risk and improve potential returns.

#### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Funds

Canadian pension funds often utilize foreign-pay preferred shares as part of their investment strategy to achieve diversification. By investing in foreign markets, these funds can access a broader range of opportunities and potentially enhance returns while managing risk through careful currency management.

#### Case Study: Major Canadian Banks

Major Canadian banks, such as RBC and TD, may issue foreign-pay preferred shares to attract international investors and diversify their capital base. These shares can be an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to the financial sector in different currencies.
