## 8.9 Types of Preferred Shares

Preferred shares are a unique class of equity securities that offer investors a blend of equity and fixed-income characteristics. They provide a fixed dividend, which is typically higher than the dividends on common shares, and have priority over common shares in the event of a company's liquidation. However, they generally do not carry voting rights. Understanding the different types of preferred shares is crucial for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and manage risk effectively. In this section, we will explore the various types of preferred shares available in the Canadian market, their features, and practical examples to illustrate their structures.

### Types of Preferred Shares

Preferred shares come in several variants, each with distinct features that cater to different investor needs and market conditions. Below, we delve into the most common types of preferred shares:

#### 1. Cumulative Preferred Shares

**Definition:** Cumulative preferred shares are those where unpaid dividends accumulate and must be paid out before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders.

**Features:**
- **Dividend Accumulation:** If a company is unable to pay dividends in a given year, the unpaid dividends are carried forward to future years.
- **Priority in Dividends:** Cumulative preferred shareholders have a higher claim on dividends compared to non-cumulative preferred shareholders.

**Example:** Consider a Canadian company, Maple Leaf Industries, which issues cumulative preferred shares with an annual dividend of $5 per share. If the company skips a dividend payment in 2023 due to financial constraints, it must pay $10 per share in 2024 before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders.

#### 2. Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares

**Definition:** Non-cumulative preferred shares do not accumulate unpaid dividends. If a company decides not to pay dividends in a particular year, shareholders cannot claim those dividends in the future.

**Features:**
- **No Dividend Carryover:** Missed dividends are not recoverable.
- **Higher Risk:** Investors face a higher risk of not receiving dividends during financial downturns.

**Example:** Suppose Northern Lights Corp issues non-cumulative preferred shares with a $4 annual dividend. If the company skips the dividend payment in 2023, shareholders have no claim to this missed dividend in subsequent years.

#### 3. Convertible Preferred Shares

**Definition:** Convertible preferred shares can be converted into a predetermined number of common shares under specific conditions.

**Features:**
- **Conversion Option:** Provides flexibility to convert into common shares, potentially benefiting from capital appreciation.
- **Conversion Ratio:** Defined at issuance, determining how many common shares each preferred share can be converted into.

**Example:** Imagine a scenario where Aurora Financial issues convertible preferred shares that can be converted into 10 common shares. If the market price of common shares rises significantly, investors might choose to convert their preferred shares to capitalize on the price increase.

#### 4. Retractable Preferred Shares

**Definition:** Retractable preferred shares allow investors to require the company to repurchase them at a predetermined price and time.

**Features:**
- **Investor Control:** Provides an exit strategy for investors, reducing interest rate risk.
- **Predetermined Terms:** The terms of retraction, including price and timing, are set at issuance.

**Example:** Assume Glacier Bay Energy issues retractable preferred shares with a retraction price of $25 per share, exercisable in 2025. Investors can choose to sell their shares back to the company at this price, providing a measure of capital protection.

#### 5. Floating-Rate Preferred Shares

**Definition:** Floating-rate preferred shares have dividends that adjust based on a reference interest rate, such as the Canadian prime rate.

**Features:**
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Dividends fluctuate with changes in interest rates, offering protection against rising rates.
- **Variable Income:** Provides a hedge against inflation and interest rate volatility.

**Example:** If Maple Bank issues floating-rate preferred shares with dividends tied to the Canadian prime rate plus 2%, and the prime rate increases from 3% to 4%, the dividend rate would adjust from 5% to 6%.

#### 6. Foreign-Pay Preferred Shares

**Definition:** Foreign-pay preferred shares have dividends paid in a foreign currency, exposing investors to currency risk.

**Features:**
- **Currency Exposure:** Offers potential benefits from currency appreciation but also poses exchange rate risk.
- **Diversification:** Provides exposure to international markets and currencies.

**Example:** A Canadian investor holds foreign-pay preferred shares from a U.S. company, receiving dividends in USD. If the Canadian dollar weakens against the USD, the investor benefits from higher CAD-equivalent dividends.

### Practical Considerations and Regulatory Insights

Investors in preferred shares must consider various factors, including dividend yield, credit risk, and market conditions. In Canada, preferred shares are subject to specific regulatory frameworks, and investors should be aware of the implications of holding these securities in registered accounts like RRSPs and TFSAs.

#### Regulatory Framework

The Canadian Securities Exchange provides guidelines on the issuance and trading of preferred shares. Investors should familiarize themselves with these regulations to ensure compliance and optimize their investment strategies.

### Conclusion

Preferred shares offer a versatile investment option, combining elements of equity and fixed income. By understanding the different types of preferred shares and their features, investors can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance. Whether seeking stable income through cumulative shares or flexibility with convertible options, preferred shares can play a vital role in a diversified investment portfolio.
