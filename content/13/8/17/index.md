## 8.17 Floating-Rate Preferred Shares

Floating-rate preferred shares are a unique class of equity securities that offer investors a blend of fixed-income stability and equity growth potential. Unlike traditional preferred shares with fixed dividends, floating-rate preferred shares have dividends that adjust based on a reference interest rate. This feature makes them particularly attractive in fluctuating interest rate environments.

### Understanding Floating-Rate Preferred Shares

**Floating-Rate Preferred Shares** are a type of preferred stock where the dividend payments are not fixed but instead vary with a benchmark interest rate, often referred to as the **Reference Interest Rate**. Common benchmarks include the Canadian Prime Rate or the Government of Canada Treasury Bill rate. The dividend is typically reset at regular intervals, such as quarterly or annually, ensuring that the payout reflects current market conditions.

#### How Dividends Adjust with Interest Rates

The dividend adjustment mechanism is the defining feature of floating-rate preferred shares. When the reference interest rate increases, the dividends on these shares also rise, providing investors with a hedge against inflation and interest rate risk. Conversely, if the reference rate decreases, the dividends will fall, which can impact the income generated from these investments.

For example, consider a floating-rate preferred share with a dividend tied to the Canadian Prime Rate plus a margin of 2%. If the Prime Rate is 3%, the dividend yield would be 5%. Should the Prime Rate increase to 4%, the dividend yield would adjust to 6%.

### Benefits of Floating-Rate Preferred Shares

Floating-rate preferred shares offer several advantages to investors, particularly in volatile interest rate environments:

1. **Interest Rate Protection**: As interest rates rise, the dividends from floating-rate preferred shares increase, protecting investors' purchasing power and providing a potential increase in income.

2. **Diversification**: These shares can add diversification to a portfolio, offering a mix of equity and fixed-income characteristics.

3. **Potential for Capital Appreciation**: While primarily income-focused, floating-rate preferred shares can also appreciate in value, especially if the issuing company's creditworthiness improves.

4. **Tax Advantages**: In Canada, dividends from preferred shares are eligible for the dividend tax credit, which can be more tax-efficient than interest income from bonds.

### Risks Associated with Floating-Rate Preferred Shares

Despite their benefits, floating-rate preferred shares also come with certain risks:

1. **Interest Rate Risk**: While they offer protection against rising rates, falling interest rates can lead to decreased dividend payments.

2. **Credit Risk**: As with any corporate security, there is a risk that the issuing company may face financial difficulties, potentially impacting dividend payments and share value.

3. **Market Risk**: The market price of floating-rate preferred shares can be volatile, influenced by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and overall market conditions.

4. **Complexity**: The structure of floating-rate preferred shares can be complex, and investors need to understand the specific terms and conditions, including the reference rate and reset periods.

### Real-World Examples

To illustrate the concept, let's consider a hypothetical example involving a major Canadian bank, such as RBC (Royal Bank of Canada). Suppose RBC issues a series of floating-rate preferred shares with dividends tied to the 3-month Government of Canada Treasury Bill rate plus a margin of 1.5%.

- **Scenario 1**: The 3-month Treasury Bill rate is 1.0%. The dividend yield on the preferred shares would be 2.5%.
- **Scenario 2**: The Treasury Bill rate rises to 2.0%. The dividend yield adjusts to 3.5%, reflecting the increase in the reference rate.

This example demonstrates how floating-rate preferred shares can provide a dynamic income stream that adjusts with prevailing interest rates, offering a potential hedge against inflation.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Investors interested in floating-rate preferred shares should be aware of the regulatory environment in Canada. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) oversee the securities market, ensuring transparency and investor protection. Additionally, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) regulates investment dealers and trading activity.

### Conclusion

Floating-rate preferred shares offer a compelling investment opportunity, particularly in environments where interest rates are expected to rise. By understanding the benefits and risks associated with these securities, investors can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance. As always, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor investment strategies to individual needs.
