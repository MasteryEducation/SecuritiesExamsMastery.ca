## 8.16 Retractable Preferred Shares

Retractable preferred shares are a unique class of preferred shares that offer investors the ability to require the issuing company to repurchase the shares at a predetermined price and time. This feature provides a level of flexibility and security that can be particularly appealing in volatile markets. In this section, we will delve into the characteristics of retractable preferred shares, compare them to other types of preferred shares, and explore their strategic role in investment portfolios.

### Key Characteristics of Retractable Preferred Shares

Retractable preferred shares are distinguished by their retractable feature, which allows investors to "retract" or sell the shares back to the issuing company at a specified price, known as the retraction price, on or after a predetermined date. This feature provides a built-in exit strategy for investors, offering a degree of capital protection.

**Characteristics:**
- **Retractable Feature:** Investors have the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at a predetermined price and date.
- **Fixed Dividend:** Like other preferred shares, retractable preferreds typically offer a fixed dividend, providing a steady income stream.
- **Priority Over Common Shares:** In the event of liquidation, retractable preferred shareholders have a higher claim on assets than common shareholders.
- **Potential for Capital Appreciation:** While primarily income-focused, retractable preferreds can also appreciate in value, especially if interest rates decline.

### Flexibility Offered by Retractable Preferred Shares

The retractable feature of these shares provides significant flexibility, making them an attractive option for investors seeking both income and capital preservation. Here are some ways retractable preferred shares offer flexibility:

1. **Capital Preservation:** The ability to retract shares at a predetermined price helps protect the investor's capital, especially in declining markets.
2. **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Retractable preferreds can be less sensitive to interest rate changes compared to perpetual preferred shares, as the retraction feature provides a clear end date.
3. **Income Stability:** With fixed dividends, investors can rely on a consistent income stream, which is particularly beneficial in low-interest environments.
4. **Strategic Portfolio Diversification:** These shares can be used to diversify a portfolio, balancing risk and return by combining income generation with capital protection.

### Comparison with Other Types of Preferred Shares

To fully appreciate the benefits of retractable preferred shares, it's essential to compare them with other types of preferred shares, such as perpetual and callable preferred shares.

**Perpetual Preferred Shares:**
- **No Maturity Date:** Unlike retractable preferreds, perpetual preferred shares do not have a maturity date, making them more sensitive to interest rate changes.
- **Higher Yield Potential:** Due to the lack of a retraction feature, perpetual preferreds often offer higher yields to compensate for the increased risk.

**Callable Preferred Shares:**
- **Issuer's Right to Call:** Callable preferred shares give the issuer the right to repurchase the shares at a specified price before maturity, which can limit the investor's upside potential.
- **Lower Yield:** The call feature often results in a lower yield compared to retractable preferreds, as the issuer can call the shares if interest rates decline.

### Practical Example: Canadian Pension Fund Strategy

Consider a Canadian pension fund looking to balance its portfolio with income-generating assets while minimizing risk. By incorporating retractable preferred shares, the fund can secure a steady income stream through fixed dividends and protect its capital with the retraction feature. This strategy allows the fund to maintain a stable cash flow, crucial for meeting its long-term liabilities.

### Regulatory Considerations and Resources

Investors in retractable preferred shares should be aware of the relevant Canadian financial regulations and institutions that govern these securities. The Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) provides resources and guidelines for trading retractable shares. Additionally, the book *Securities Regulation in Canada* by Bruce G. Richmond offers comprehensive insights into the regulatory framework surrounding these instruments.

### Conclusion

Retractable preferred shares offer a unique blend of income stability, capital preservation, and flexibility, making them a valuable addition to any investment portfolio. By understanding their characteristics and strategic applications, investors can effectively leverage these instruments to achieve their financial goals.
