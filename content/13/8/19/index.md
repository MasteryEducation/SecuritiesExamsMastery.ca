## 8.19 Other Types of Preferred Shares

In the realm of equity securities, preferred shares occupy a unique niche, offering investors a blend of equity and fixed-income characteristics. While the most common types of preferred shares are well-known, there are other, less common varieties that can offer distinct advantages to investors. This section will explore two such types: Participating Preferred Shares and Deferred Preferred Shares. Understanding these can enhance your investment strategy, particularly within the Canadian financial landscape.

### Participating Preferred Shares

**Participating Preferred Shares** are a unique class of preferred shares that provide investors with the opportunity to receive additional dividends beyond the fixed rate. This feature allows shareholders to participate in the company's profits, typically after common shareholders have received their dividends.

#### Unique Features

- **Additional Dividends:** Beyond the fixed dividend, participating preferred shareholders may receive extra dividends if the company performs exceptionally well.
- **Profit Sharing:** These shares allow investors to benefit from the company's profitability, aligning their interests more closely with common shareholders.
- **Priority in Liquidation:** Like other preferred shares, they have a higher claim on assets than common shares in the event of liquidation.

#### Investment Purposes

Participating preferred shares are attractive to investors seeking a balance between the stability of fixed-income investments and the potential for higher returns associated with equity investments. They are particularly appealing in a robust economic environment where companies are likely to generate substantial profits.

#### Example

Consider a Canadian technology company, TechInnovate Inc., which issues participating preferred shares. If TechInnovate declares a dividend of $2 per share for common shareholders, participating preferred shareholders might receive their fixed dividend plus an additional amount, say $0.50 per share, reflecting the company's strong financial performance.

### Deferred Preferred Shares

**Deferred Preferred Shares** are another intriguing type of preferred shares. These shares do not pay out regular dividends but instead accumulate dividends to be paid at a later date, often upon maturity.

#### Unique Features

- **Deferred Dividends:** Dividends are accumulated and paid out at a specified future date, providing a lump sum payment.
- **Tax Efficiency:** In some cases, deferred dividends can be more tax-efficient, as they may be taxed at a lower rate when received as a lump sum.
- **Fixed Maturity Date:** These shares often come with a predetermined maturity date, at which point the accumulated dividends are paid.

#### Investment Purposes

Deferred preferred shares are suitable for investors who do not require immediate income but are looking for a future payout. They can be a strategic choice for retirement planning, where the investor anticipates needing funds at a specific future date.

#### Example

Imagine a Canadian utility company, GreenEnergy Corp., issuing deferred preferred shares with a maturity of 10 years. Investors in these shares would not receive annual dividends but would instead receive a substantial payout at the end of the 10-year period, which includes all accumulated dividends.

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Investors interested in participating or deferred preferred shares should be aware of the relevant Canadian financial regulations and resources. The Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) provides valuable information on different types of preferred shares, including participating preferred shares. Additionally, the book *Preferred Stocks: Advantages and Disadvantages* by Anil Kakhani offers further insights into the benefits and drawbacks of investing in preferred stocks.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When investing in participating or deferred preferred shares, consider the following best practices:

- **Thorough Research:** Understand the terms and conditions of the preferred shares, including dividend policies and maturity dates.
- **Market Conditions:** Assess the economic environment and the issuing company's financial health to gauge the potential for additional dividends or the security of deferred payouts.
- **Tax Implications:** Consult with a financial advisor to understand the tax implications of receiving dividends, whether regular or deferred.

Common pitfalls include:

- **Overlooking Terms:** Failing to fully understand the specific terms of the preferred shares can lead to unexpected outcomes.
- **Ignoring Market Trends:** Not considering the broader market conditions that might affect the company's profitability and, consequently, the dividends.

### Conclusion

Participating and deferred preferred shares offer unique opportunities for investors seeking a blend of stability and potential growth. By understanding their features and purposes, investors can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals. As always, staying informed about Canadian financial regulations and leveraging available resources will enhance your investment strategy.
