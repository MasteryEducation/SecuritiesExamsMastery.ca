## 8.7 Common Share Benefits and Risks

Investing in common shares is a fundamental aspect of building a diversified investment portfolio. Common shares represent ownership in a company and provide investors with the potential for capital appreciation and dividend income. However, like all investments, common shares come with their own set of benefits and risks. Understanding these elements is crucial for making informed investment decisions and effectively managing a portfolio.

### Benefits of Investing in Common Shares

#### 1. Capital Appreciation

One of the primary benefits of investing in common shares is the potential for capital appreciation. As a company grows and becomes more profitable, the value of its shares can increase, providing investors with the opportunity to sell their shares at a higher price than they paid. This potential for growth makes common shares an attractive investment for those seeking long-term wealth accumulation.

#### 2. Dividend Income

Many companies distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. While not all common shares pay dividends, those that do can provide a steady stream of income. This is particularly appealing for investors looking for regular income, such as retirees. Canadian companies often offer dividends that are eligible for the dividend tax credit, providing a tax-efficient income stream.

#### 3. Voting Rights

Common shareholders typically have voting rights, allowing them to influence corporate governance by voting on important issues such as the election of the board of directors and major corporate policies. This ownership stake gives investors a voice in the company's future direction.

#### 4. Liquidity

Common shares are generally more liquid than other types of investments, such as real estate or private equity. This means they can be bought and sold relatively quickly on stock exchanges, providing investors with flexibility and the ability to respond to market changes.

#### 5. Diversification

Investing in a variety of common shares across different sectors and industries can help diversify a portfolio, reducing overall risk. By spreading investments across multiple companies, investors can mitigate the impact of poor performance by any single company.

### Risks Associated with Common Shares

#### 1. Market Risk

Market risk, also known as systematic risk, refers to the potential for losses due to adverse market movements. Factors such as economic downturns, geopolitical events, or changes in interest rates can affect the entire market, impacting the value of common shares. This risk is inherent in all equity investments and cannot be eliminated, but it can be managed through diversification and hedging strategies.

#### 2. Investment Risk

Investment risk is the potential loss of investment value. This can occur if a company underperforms, leading to a decline in its share price. Factors contributing to investment risk include poor management decisions, increased competition, or changes in consumer preferences. Investors must conduct thorough research and analysis to assess a company's financial health and growth prospects before investing.

#### 3. Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell an investment quickly without a significant price discount. While common shares are generally liquid, certain stocks, particularly those of smaller companies or those traded on less active exchanges, may experience lower liquidity. This can make it difficult to sell shares at a desired price, especially during market downturns.

#### 4. Volatility

Common shares can be volatile, with prices fluctuating significantly over short periods. This volatility can be driven by market sentiment, news events, or changes in a company's financial performance. While volatility can present opportunities for profit, it also increases the risk of loss, particularly for short-term investors.

### Strategies for Mitigating Risks in Common Share Investing

#### 1. Diversification

Diversification is a key strategy for mitigating risk. By investing in a broad range of companies across different sectors and geographic regions, investors can reduce the impact of poor performance by any single investment. Diversification can be achieved through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or by building a portfolio of individual stocks.

#### 2. Long-Term Investment Horizon

Adopting a long-term investment horizon can help investors ride out short-term market volatility and benefit from the overall upward trend of the stock market. Historically, equities have provided higher returns over the long term compared to other asset classes, despite short-term fluctuations.

#### 3. Fundamental Analysis

Conducting thorough fundamental analysis is essential for assessing a company's financial health and growth prospects. This involves analyzing financial statements, understanding industry trends, and evaluating management effectiveness. By focusing on companies with strong fundamentals, investors can reduce investment risk.

#### 4. Regular Portfolio Review

Regularly reviewing and rebalancing a portfolio ensures that it remains aligned with an investor's risk tolerance and financial goals. This involves assessing the performance of individual investments and making adjustments as needed to maintain the desired asset allocation.

#### 5. Use of Stop-Loss Orders

Stop-loss orders can be used to limit potential losses by automatically selling a stock when it reaches a predetermined price. This strategy can help protect against significant declines in share value, particularly in volatile markets.
