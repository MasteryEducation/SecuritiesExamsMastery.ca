## 8.2 Common Shares

Common shares represent a fundamental component of the equity securities market, offering investors a stake in a company's ownership. As an essential part of the Canadian financial landscape, understanding common shares is crucial for anyone involved in securities transactions or investment strategies. This section delves into the core characteristics of common shares, their benefits and risks, and the evidence of ownership, providing a comprehensive guide for both novice and seasoned investors.

### Defining Common Shares

Common shares, also known as ordinary shares, are equity securities that grant shareholders ownership in a corporation. These shares typically confer voting rights, allowing shareholders to influence corporate governance by voting on key issues such as the election of the board of directors. Additionally, common shareholders may receive dividends, which are distributions of a company's profits.

#### Core Characteristics of Common Shares

1. **Voting Rights:** Common shareholders usually have the right to vote on corporate matters, such as mergers, acquisitions, and the election of directors. This voting power gives shareholders a voice in the company's strategic direction.

2. **Dividends:** While not guaranteed, common shareholders may receive dividends, which are typically paid out of the company's earnings. Dividends can be a source of income for investors, although they are often variable and depend on the company's profitability.

3. **Residual Claim:** In the event of a company's liquidation, common shareholders have a residual claim on assets, meaning they are paid after creditors and preferred shareholders. This positions common shares as higher risk compared to debt securities and preferred shares.

4. **Potential for Capital Appreciation:** Common shares offer the potential for capital appreciation, which is the increase in the value of the shares over time. This potential makes them attractive for investors seeking growth.

### Benefits of Common Share Ownership

Owning common shares can provide several advantages, making them a popular choice for investors seeking both income and growth opportunities.

#### Capital Appreciation

One of the primary benefits of investing in common shares is the potential for capital appreciation. As a company grows and becomes more profitable, the value of its common shares may increase, providing investors with the opportunity to sell their shares at a higher price than they paid. This appreciation can significantly enhance an investor's portfolio over time.

#### Dividends

While not all companies pay dividends, those that do offer investors a regular income stream. Dividends can be particularly appealing for income-focused investors, such as retirees, who rely on these payments to supplement their income. Canadian companies often pay dividends that qualify for the dividend tax credit, providing a tax-efficient income source.

#### Voting Rights

The voting rights associated with common shares allow investors to participate in corporate governance. This involvement can be particularly important for activist investors who seek to influence corporate policies and strategies.

### Risks Associated with Owning Common Shares

Despite their benefits, common shares also come with inherent risks that investors must consider.

#### Market Volatility

Common shares are subject to market volatility, meaning their prices can fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions, economic factors, and company performance. This volatility can lead to substantial losses if the market or the specific company performs poorly.

#### Dividend Uncertainty

Dividends on common shares are not guaranteed and can be reduced or eliminated if a company faces financial difficulties. Investors relying on dividend income must be aware of this risk and consider the company's financial health and dividend history.

#### Residual Claim

In the event of a company's bankruptcy or liquidation, common shareholders are last in line to receive any remaining assets after creditors and preferred shareholders have been paid. This residual claim status increases the risk of losing the entire investment if the company fails.

### Evidence of Ownership

Ownership of common shares can be evidenced through street certificates or electronic records, each offering different advantages.

#### Street Certificates

Street certificates are physical documents that represent ownership of shares. While they provide tangible proof of ownership, they are less common today due to the convenience and efficiency of electronic records.

#### Electronic Records

Most common shares are now held in electronic form, recorded in a brokerage account. This method simplifies the process of buying, selling, and transferring shares, making it the preferred choice for most investors. Electronic records are maintained by clearing and depository institutions, such as the Canadian Depository for Securities (CDS).

### Canadian Financial Regulations and Resources

Investors in common shares must navigate a regulatory landscape designed to protect their interests and ensure market integrity. In Canada, the primary regulatory bodies include the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). These organizations establish rules and guidelines for trading securities, including common shares.

### Conclusion

Common shares offer investors a unique opportunity to participate in the growth and governance of companies. While they provide potential benefits such as capital appreciation and dividends, they also carry risks that must be carefully managed. By understanding the characteristics, benefits, and risks of common shares, investors can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
