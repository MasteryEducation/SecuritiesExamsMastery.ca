## 4.22 Determinants of Exchange Rates

Exchange rates, the price of one currency in terms of another, are influenced by a multitude of factors. Understanding these determinants is crucial for financial professionals, as they impact everything from international trade to investment strategies. In this section, we will explore the key determinants of exchange rates, focusing on their influence on the Canadian dollar (CAD).

### Key Determinants of Exchange Rates

#### 1. Commodity Prices

**Commodity Prices** refer to the market prices of raw materials such as oil, gold, and agricultural products. For a resource-rich country like Canada, commodity prices play a significant role in determining the value of its currency. 

- **Influence on Currency:** Higher commodity prices generally lead to a stronger CAD because Canada is a major exporter of commodities. When prices rise, foreign buyers need more CAD to purchase Canadian goods, increasing demand for the currency.

- **Example:** The CAD often appreciates when oil prices rise, as oil is a significant export for Canada. Conversely, a drop in oil prices can lead to a depreciation of the CAD.

#### 2. Inflation Rate

The **Inflation Rate** is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, eroding purchasing power.

- **Influence on Currency:** A lower inflation rate in Canada compared to other countries can increase the CAD's value. This is because lower inflation typically leads to higher purchasing power and potentially higher interest rates, attracting foreign investment.

- **Example:** If Canada's inflation rate is lower than that of the United States, the CAD might appreciate against the USD as investors seek the stability of the Canadian economy.

#### 3. Interest Rates

Interest rates, set by a country's central bank, are a critical determinant of exchange rates.

- **Influence on Currency:** Higher interest rates offer lenders in an economy a higher return relative to other countries. Therefore, higher interest rates attract foreign capital, causing the currency to appreciate.

- **Example:** If the Bank of Canada raises interest rates, it could lead to an appreciation of the CAD as investors move capital to Canada to benefit from higher returns.

#### 4. Trade Balances

The **Trade Balance** is the difference between a country's exports and imports.

- **Influence on Currency:** A trade surplus (exports > imports) typically strengthens a currency because foreign buyers must purchase the domestic currency to pay for the country's goods and services. Conversely, a trade deficit can weaken a currency.

- **Example:** Canada's trade surplus with the United States can lead to a stronger CAD, as U.S. companies need CAD to buy Canadian goods.

#### 5. Economic Performance

The overall economic performance of a country can significantly impact its currency value.

- **Influence on Currency:** Strong economic growth attracts foreign investment, increasing demand for the domestic currency. Conversely, economic downturns can lead to currency depreciation.

- **Example:** If Canada's GDP growth outpaces that of other major economies, it could lead to an appreciation of the CAD as investors seek to capitalize on growth opportunities.

#### 6. Public Debt

Public debt levels can influence investor confidence and currency value.

- **Influence on Currency:** High public debt may lead to inflationary pressures and a devaluation of the currency. Conversely, manageable debt levels can enhance investor confidence and strengthen the currency.

- **Example:** If Canada maintains a low debt-to-GDP ratio compared to other countries, it may bolster confidence in the CAD, leading to appreciation.

#### 7. Political Stability

Political stability and economic performance are closely linked, influencing investor confidence and currency value.

- **Influence on Currency:** Countries with stable political environments tend to attract more foreign investment, strengthening their currency. Political instability can lead to currency depreciation as investors seek safer havens.

- **Example:** Canada's stable political environment often contributes to a strong CAD, as it is perceived as a safe investment destination.

### Interplay of Determinants

The determinants of exchange rates do not operate in isolation. They interact in complex ways, influencing the supply and demand for a currency. For instance, a rise in commodity prices might lead to economic growth, which could prompt the central bank to raise interest rates, further strengthening the currency. Conversely, political instability might lead to capital flight, weakening the currency despite strong economic fundamentals.

### Case Study: The Canadian Dollar

To illustrate the interplay of these determinants, consider the Canadian dollar's performance during the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis led to a drop in global commodity prices, negatively impacting the CAD. However, Canada's strong banking sector and prudent fiscal policies helped stabilize the currency relatively quickly compared to other nations.
