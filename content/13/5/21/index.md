## 5.20 Determinants of Exchange Rates

Exchange rates play a crucial role in the global economy, influencing trade, investment, and economic stability. Understanding the determinants of exchange rates is essential for financial professionals, particularly in the context of the Canadian dollar (CAD). This section delves into the key factors that influence exchange rates, providing insights into how these determinants interact and affect the value of the Canadian dollar.

### Key Determinants of Exchange Rates

Exchange rates are influenced by a myriad of factors, each contributing to the supply and demand dynamics of a currency. The primary determinants include commodity prices, inflation, interest rates, trade balances, economic performance, public debt, and political stability. Let's explore each of these in detail.

#### 1. Commodity Prices

Canada is a major exporter of commodities such as oil, natural gas, and minerals. The prices of these commodities significantly impact the Canadian dollar. When commodity prices rise, the value of the Canadian dollar tends to increase due to higher export revenues, leading to greater demand for the currency.

**Example:** During periods of rising oil prices, such as in the early 2000s, the Canadian dollar appreciated against the US dollar as Canada's oil exports became more valuable.

#### 2. Inflation

Inflation affects the purchasing power of a currency. A country with lower inflation rates than its trading partners will see an appreciation in its currency value. Conversely, higher inflation can lead to depreciation.

**Example:** If Canada's inflation rate is consistently lower than that of the United States, the Canadian dollar may appreciate due to increased purchasing power relative to the US dollar.

#### 3. Interest Rates

Interest rates are a critical determinant of exchange rates. Higher interest rates offer lenders in an economy a higher return relative to other countries. As a result, higher interest rates attract foreign capital, causing the currency to appreciate.

**Example:** If the Bank of Canada raises interest rates while the Federal Reserve maintains its rates, the Canadian dollar might strengthen as investors seek higher returns in Canada.

#### 4. Trade Balances

The balance of trade, which is the difference between a country's exports and imports, influences exchange rates. A trade surplus (more exports than imports) typically leads to currency appreciation, while a trade deficit can cause depreciation.

**Example:** A significant increase in Canadian exports to China could lead to a stronger Canadian dollar due to increased demand for CAD to pay for Canadian goods.

#### 5. Economic Performance

A strong economy attracts foreign investment, leading to currency appreciation. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, and manufacturing output provide insights into a country's economic health.

**Example:** Robust economic growth in Canada, driven by innovation and technology sectors, can lead to a stronger Canadian dollar as investors seek opportunities in a thriving economy.

#### 6. Public Debt

High levels of public debt can lead to inflation and currency depreciation. Investors may perceive high debt levels as a risk, leading to reduced demand for the currency.

**Example:** If Canada's public debt levels rise significantly without corresponding economic growth, the Canadian dollar may weaken due to concerns about fiscal sustainability.

#### 7. Political Stability

Political stability and sound governance are attractive to investors. A stable political environment reduces uncertainty, leading to increased foreign investment and currency appreciation.

**Example:** Political turmoil or uncertainty in Canada could lead to a depreciation of the Canadian dollar as investors seek safer havens.

### Interplay of Determinants

The determinants of exchange rates do not operate in isolation. They interact in complex ways, influencing the supply and demand for the Canadian dollar. For instance, a rise in commodity prices may boost economic performance, leading to higher interest rates and a stronger currency. Conversely, political instability could undermine economic confidence, leading to currency depreciation despite favorable trade balances.

### Real-World Impact on the Canadian Dollar

To illustrate the impact of these determinants, consider the following case study:

**Case Study: The 2008 Financial Crisis**

During the 2008 financial crisis, global commodity prices plummeted, leading to a significant depreciation of the Canadian dollar. The crisis also resulted in lower interest rates as the Bank of Canada sought to stimulate the economy. Despite Canada's relatively stable political environment, the interplay of low commodity prices and reduced interest rates led to a weaker Canadian dollar.
