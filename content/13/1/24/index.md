At its core, the industry facilitates the efficient allocation of capital, enabling businesses to grow and investors to achieve their financial goals. Key themes include:

Institutions such as the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and provincial securities commissions play crucial roles in maintaining these standards.

### Interconnectedness of Financial Intermediaries and Market Participants

The Canadian securities industry is a complex ecosystem where various financial intermediaries and market participants interact seamlessly. These include:
