## 1.7 Services Provided by Investment Dealers

Investment dealers play a pivotal role in the Canadian securities industry, acting as intermediaries between issuers and investors in both primary and secondary markets. Their services are crucial for the efficient functioning of financial markets, providing liquidity, facilitating capital raising, and offering expert advice to investors. This section delves into the various services offered by investment dealers, their role as market makers, and how they assist clients in making informed investment decisions.

### Services in the Primary Market

In the primary market, investment dealers assist companies and governments in raising capital by underwriting and distributing new securities. This process involves several key services:

1. **Underwriting:** Investment dealers purchase securities from the issuer and sell them to the public. They assume the risk of selling the securities at a predetermined price, ensuring that the issuer receives the necessary funds.

2. **Advisory Services:** Dealers provide strategic advice on the timing, pricing, and structure of new issues. They help issuers navigate regulatory requirements and market conditions to optimize their capital-raising efforts.

3. **Distribution:** Leveraging their extensive networks, investment dealers distribute new securities to institutional and retail investors. This involves marketing the securities and managing the logistics of the issuance process.

#### Case Study: RBC Capital Markets and a Major IPO

RBC Capital Markets, a leading Canadian investment dealer, played a significant role in the initial public offering (IPO) of a major Canadian technology firm. By underwriting the IPO, RBC Capital Markets helped the company raise substantial capital to fund its expansion plans. The dealer's expertise in pricing and distribution ensured a successful launch, with the shares being well-received by the market.

### Services in the Secondary Market

In the secondary market, investment dealers facilitate the buying and selling of existing securities, providing liquidity and price discovery. Key services include:

1. **Market Making:** Dealers act as market makers by maintaining an inventory of securities and quoting buy and sell prices. This activity enhances market liquidity, allowing investors to trade securities with ease.

2. **Brokerage Services:** Investment dealers execute buy and sell orders on behalf of clients, offering access to various markets, including the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).

3. **Research and Analysis:** Dealers provide in-depth research and analysis on securities, industries, and market trends. This information helps investors make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively.
